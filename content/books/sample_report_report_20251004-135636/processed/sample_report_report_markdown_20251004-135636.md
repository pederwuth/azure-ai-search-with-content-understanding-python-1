# IMF Executive Board Concludes 2024 Article IV Consultation with the United States


## FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, DC - July 17, 2024: The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) concluded the Article IV consultation1 with the United States.

The U.S. economy has turned in a strong performance over the past few years. Hysteresis
effects from the pandemic did not materialize and both activity and employment now exceed
pre-pandemic expectations. Real incomes were diminished by the unexpected rise in inflation
in 2022 but have now risen above pre-pandemic levels. Job growth has been particularly fast
with 16 million new jobs created since end-2020. However, income and wealth gains have
been uneven across the income distribution and poverty remains high, particularly following
the expiration of pandemic-era support.

The ongoing disinflation has taken a relatively light toll on the economy. The Federal Reserve
responded to record-high inflation by raising the policy rate by 525bps which bolstered policy
credibility, provided an anchor for wages and prices, and helped guide inflation back toward
the FOMC's 2 percent goal. Wealth gains and limited refinancing needs have bolstered
household and corporate balance sheets against the contractionary impact of higher interest
rates. Monetary policy tightening was also supported by important supply-side gains, including
an expansion of labor supply from immigrant inflows. PCE inflation was 2.7 percent in April
(down from a peak of 7.1 percent in 2022) and is expected to return to 2 percent by mid-2025.

The general government fiscal deficit and debt, as a share of GDP, are both projected to
remain well above pre-pandemic forecasts over the medium-term. Specifically, under current
policies, the general government debt is expected to rise steadily and exceed 140 percent of
GDP by 2032. Similarly, the general government deficit is expected to remain around
21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV consultation.

Several steps have been taken to strengthen the functioning of the Treasury market and to
better insulate money market funds from liquidity shortfalls. The pace of shrinking of the
Federal Reserve's balance sheet has begun to taper. However, concrete actions have been
lacking in mitigating the banking system vulnerabilities that came to light in 2023.


### Executive Board Assessment2

Executive Directors welcomed the remarkable performance of the U.S. economy over the past
few years and noted that the ongoing disinflation process, aided by higher productivity growth
and expanded labor supply, including through immigration, has taken a relatively light toll on
economic activity. While the outlook remains positive, Directors emphasized that upside risks

1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff
team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors,
and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

to inflation need to be monitored and determined actions will be necessary to address fiscal
imbalances, financial vulnerabilities, as well as the increased inequality and poverty, which
has risen back to pre-pandemic levels.

Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to price stability and successful
disinflation. Nevertheless, given salient upside risks to inflation and strong performance of the
economy, they noted that the Federal Reserve should not reduce its policy rate until there is
clearer evidence that inflation is sustainably returning to its 2 percent target. Clear
communication, including forward guidance, will help guide market expectations in line with
the Fed's intended policy path.

Directors noted that high fiscal deficits and the ongoing increase in the U.S. public debt to
GDP ratio pose risks not only for the U.S. but also the global economy. They stressed the
pressing need for a frontloaded fiscal adjustment, through both revenue and spending
measures, while redirecting some of the fiscal savings to programs to alleviate poverty. A
structural and long-term solution to address the issues related to the debt ceiling would also
be beneficial.

Directors welcomed the decrease in financial risks since 2023 and the implementation of
critical reforms, in particular those aimed at improving the Treasury market functioning. They
noted that concrete actions are needed to mitigate the remaining banking system
vulnerabilities and called on the authorities to fully implement the final components of the
Basel III agreement, increase regulatory requirements for mid-sized banks, and further
strengthen supervisory oversight and practices. Directors encouraged the authorities to
address the remaining FSAP recommendations.

Directors welcomed the U.S. voluntary assessment of transnational aspects of corruption and
encouraged the authorities to implement the remaining OECD Working Group on Bribery
phase IV recommendations. They also highlighted the significant role of migrant inflows in
easing supply-demand imbalances and noted that a more orderly approach to immigration
would be desirable. Continuing to address climate related challenges also remains important.

Directors noted the ongoing intensification of trade restrictions as well as the domestic content
provision in various fiscal programs, which create a risk for both the U.S. and global economy.
They urged the authorities to unwind obstacles to free trade and instead bolster
competitiveness through investment in workers and infrastructure. Working with international
partners to address the core issues that risk undermining the global trade and investment
system, including through concerted efforts to strengthen the WTO and ensure a robust and
modern multilateral rules-based system, will be critical.

## UNITED STATES

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2024 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

<!-- PageHeader="July 1, 2024" -->


### KEY MESSAGES

Activity and jobs. The U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the
past few years. Hysteresis effects from the pandemic did not materialize and both
activity and employment now exceed pre-pandemic expectations. Real incomes were
diminished by the unexpected rise in inflation in 2022 but have now risen above pre-
pandemic levels. Job growth has been particularly fast, with 16 million new jobs created
since end-2020. However, income and wealth gains have been uneven across the income
distribution and poverty remains high, particularly following the expiration of pandemic-
era support. The outlook is for a continued healthy rate of growth with balanced risks
around the baseline forecast.

Inflation. The ongoing disinflation has taken a relatively light toll on the economy. PCE
inflation peaked at 7.1 percent in mid-2022, the highest level since the early 1980s. The
Federal Reserve responded by raising the policy rate by 525bps which bolstered policy
credibility, provided an anchor for wages and prices, and helped guide inflation back
toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal. Policymakers were also fortunate that their efforts
were accompanied by important supply gains as supply chains repaired, the labor force
expanded, and labor productivity picked up. PCE inflation was 2.7 percent in April and is
expected to return to 2 percent by mid-2025. There are, though, important upside risks
to the outlook for inflation.

Monetary policy. Despite the important progress in returning inflation towards its
2 percent goal, the Federal Reserve should wait to reduce its policy rate until at least late
2024. With the economy humming along at an impressive rate the U.S. has not paid a
high cost to current monetary policy settings (i.e., in terms of slower growth, job losses,
or reduced labor force participation). This provides significant room for maneuver within
the Fed's mandate of price stability and maximum employment. Given salient upside
risks to inflation-brought into stark relief by data outturns earlier this year-it would be
prudent to lower the policy rate only after there is clearer evidence in the data that
inflation is sustainably returning to the FOMC's 2 percent goal. Continuing to clearly
communicate the FOMC's interpretation of incoming data, and adjusting forward
guidance accordingly, should ensure that the needed shifts in the monetary stance are
well understood and smoothly absorbed. The decision to reduce the pace of run-off of
the Fed's holdings of Treasuries will usefully provide more time to judge the appropriate
long-term size of the Fed's balance sheet.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="UNITED STATES" -->

Fiscal policy. There is a pressing need to reverse the ongoing increase in public debt. The
general government fiscal deficit and debt are both projected to remain well above pre-
pandemic forecasts over the medium-term. Such high deficits and debt create a growing risk to
the U.S. and global economy. To put debt-GDP on a clear downward trajectory, a frontloaded
fiscal adjustment will be needed that shifts the general government to a primary surplus of
around 1 percent of GDP (an adjustment of around 4 percent of GDP relative to the current
baseline). There are various options to achieve this adjustment over the medium-term including
raising indirect taxes, progressively increasing income taxes (including for those earning less than
US$400,000 per year), eliminating a range of tax expenditures, and reforming entitlement
programs. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should, though, be deployed to increase
spending on programs to alleviate poverty.

Financial oversight. Financial stability risks have diminished since the time of the 2023 Article IV
consultation and some critical financial sector reforms are being implemented. For example,
welcome steps have been taken to strengthen the functioning of the Treasury market and to
better insulate money market funds from liquidity shortfalls. However, concrete actions have
been lacking in mitigating the banking system vulnerabilities that came to light in 2023. There is
a need, therefore, to fully implement the final components of the Basel III agreement, apply
similar regulatory requirements to all banks with US$100 billion or more in assets (including
supervisory stress tests), further strengthen supervisory oversight and practices, re-examine the
coverage of deposit insurance, and recalibrate bank liquidity requirements and liquidity stress
tests to better take account of the potential for fast-moving deposit outflows. Other pockets of
vulnerability-notably as relates to nonbank mortgage companies and the possible migration of
assets to collective investment funds-also warrant attention.

Trade. The ongoing intensification of trade restrictions and the increased use of preferential
treatments for domestic versus foreign commercial interests represent a growing downside risk
to both the U.S. and the global economy. The U.S. should actively engage with its major trading
partners to address the core issues-including concerns over unfair trade practices, supply chain
fragilities, and national security-that risk undermining the global trade and investment system.
Tariffs, nontariff barriers, and domestic content provisions are not the right solutions since they
distort trade and investment flows and risk creating a slippery slope that undermines the
multilateral trading system, weakens global supply chains and spurs retaliatory actions by trading
partners. These policies are ultimately bad for U.S. growth, productivity and labor market
outcomes and the evidence suggest their costs are largely borne by U.S. firms and consumers.
The U.S. should unwind obstacles to free trade and seek instead to bolster competitiveness
through investments in worker training, apprenticeships and infrastructure.

Macroeconomic imbalances. The evidence suggests that the U.S. economy has largely returned
to balance. Labor markets imbalances have been mostly resolved with the economy now
appearing to be operating slightly above maximum employment. By mid-2025, inflation is
expected to return to the FOMC's 2 percent goal which will, in turn, allow the policy rate to
return to a neutral setting. The external position is assessed to be broadly in line with the level
implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. However, as discussed above, the
fiscal deficit is much too large and public debt-GDP ratio is well above prudent levels.

## A RESILIENT ECONOMY

1\.
The U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few years.
Rather than facing lasting negative hysteresis effects from the pandemic, the U.S. is the only G20
economy that is now operating above the levels of output and employment expected prior to the
pandemic. Q4/Q4 growth in 2023 (at 3.1 percent)
was almost three times that expected at the time
2023 Real GDP
(percent deviation from pre-crisis trend)
of the last Article IV and core PCE inflation was
1.0
almost 1 percentage point lower. The rebound has
-0.5
been characterized by important gains on both the
demand and supply side which has allowed
-2.0
inflation to head back to the FOMC's medium-term
-3.5
target without a major dislocation in the real
economy. The strength of the U.S. economy and
-5.0
the relatively quick disinflation have had large,

### A. What Has Underpinned the Post-Pandemic Strength in Demand?

2\.
The unprecedented increase in the fiscal deficit during the depths of the pandemic
provided significant fuel to demand. The cumulative increase in federal spending in 2020-21 was
around 19 percent of GDP. While somewhat smaller than that of the Euro Area, the extraordinary
breadth of this (relatively untargeted) fiscal support is providing a material boost to aggregate
demand in 2023-24 through multiple channels:

. Federal transfers to households (through stimulus checks, food assistance, child and earned
income tax credits, and unemployment insurance), combined with foregone consumption and
debt rescheduling (e.g., of mortgages and student loans), added an estimated 10 percent of
GDP to household savings by end-2021. These resources were then subsequently available to
support consumption even as real disposable income fell (due to the post-pandemic burst of
inflation).

· Large transfers to state and local governments prevented a drawdown of rainy-day funds in the
pandemic, providing subnational governments with sizable buffers which, in turn, allowed them
to maintain their spending above pre-pandemic levels.

· Around 31/2 percent of GDP in federal loans provided through the Payroll Protection Program
were subsequently forgiven, bolstering corporate balance sheets. Other targeted pandemic
measures (e.g., for airlines) also supported the corporate sector.

### 3. Rising household wealth has been a key determinant in supporting consumer demand

(Box 1). The significant build-up of savings during the pandemic (described above) allowed
households to pay down costly revolving credit, build-up financial assets, and subsequently benefit
from the post-pandemic run-up in asset prices. In addition, homeowners benefited from an almost
50 percent increase in the average house price since end-2019. As a result, real median net wealth in
the U.S. has grown by 34 percent since 2019 (compared to a 5 percent increase in the Euro Area
over the same period).1 Notably, wealth rose across the whole income distribution (albeit with much
larger gains for the highest income households).

This strength in aggregate consumption, however, masks an upswing in poverty and
rising signs of economic distress among low-income households. During the recovery from the
pandemic, labor shortages lifted real wages at the bottom of the income distribution and led to a
compression of wage inequality.2 Despite these gains, poverty increased by 4.6 percentage points in
2022 and the child poverty rate more than doubled.3 This rise in poverty can be directly attributed to
the expiration of pandemic-era assistance, particularly changes that had been made to the Child Tax
Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).

### 5. Both households and corporates have been insulated from the impact of higher interest rates.

. During the pandemic, both corporate and household borrowers locked in low rates at long
maturities, paying down higher cost, floating rate debt. Around one half of mortgages reset at
lower rates during 2020-21 (either through refinancing operations or when the mortgage
refreshed through home sales). As a result, by end-2021, over 95 percent of mortgages were at
low, fixed rates.5 Similarly, the average duration of investment grade corporate bonds rose
during 2020-21 with new debt being contracted at relatively low yields.

· Firms and households were able to increase their holdings of short duration financial assets.
Households extracted around US$0.5 trillion in home equity during 2020-21 which, alongside
the higher savings described above, increased their holdings of bank deposits and money
market funds by almost 3 percent of GDP. Similarly, nonfinancial corporates now hold
2.3 percent of GDP more in bank deposits and money market funds than they did at end-2019.

Together, these two dynamics have resulted in a muted impact of higher interest rates on
consumption and corporate investment.6 Indeed, over the past two years, the combination of low-

non-cash transfers while using geographically adjusted poverty thresholds (Census Bureau, 2023).

5 See A. Haughwout et al., "The Great Pandemic Mortgage Refinance Boom", Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

6 Higher interest rates did though have a clear impact through other channels, notably subtracting around 1/2 percent
from growth in both 2022 and 2023 as a result of the decline in residential investment.

cost liabilities at a fixed rate and a floating rate on liquid assets actually led to a substantial decline
in net interest payments for nonfinancial corporates (in contrast with those in the Euro Area) and
only a small increase for households due to rising payment obligations on auto loans and revolving
credit (Box 2). This could suggest that monetary policy transmission has potentially been somewhat
less impactful than in past tightening cycles7 (Box 3).

The U.S. has seen a material improvement in its terms of trade since end-2019 which
supported aggregate demand. In large part, this was a product of the U.S. already being a net
exporter of natural gas, crude oil, and petroleum products prior to the pandemic. When global
energy prices rose as economies reopened and, particularly, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine
the U.S. was a net beneficiary. In contrast to much of Europe, high world energy prices appeared to
do little to dent consumer demand in the U.S. but did catalyze higher oil and gas production (which
are now at record levels).

### Box 1. Why Has Consumption Been So Strong?1

Private consumption rebounded swiftly from its
pandemic trough and returned to the pre-COVID trend
by early 2021. The strength in consumption was visible
across all income groups, although higher income
households contributed the most to aggregate
consumption growth (the top quintile accounted for
about 40 percent of total consumption growth).

Solid real incomes and the boost to savings during the
pandemic helped support consumption. However, the
large increase in housing wealth was quantitatively the
most important factor. This is borne out by analysis of
both state and household level data.

Not only were the wealth gains large but the elasticity
of consumption with respect to housing wealth actually increased after the pandemic. This increase in
consumption elasticity to wealth gains was most pronounced for homeowners, especially those without a
mortgage. On the other hand, the propensity to consume out of real income has been relatively stable
throughout the pre- and post-pandemic periods.

Quantitatively, higher housing wealth accounted for more than half of the increase in consumption relative
to end-2019 levels. Gains in real wages explained around one-quarter of the increase. The savings
accumulated during the pandemic bolstered consumption during 2022 but the impact has waned during
2023 (as savings were run down by liquidity constrained households).


<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Pre-COVID vs Post-COVID Income and Housing Wealth
**ChartType**: bar
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Housing market
**DetailedDescription**: The bar chart compares income and housing wealth for different groups before and after the COVID pandemic. The groups include homeowners with a mortgage, homeowners without a mortgage, and renters. The chart uses two sets of bars for each group: light blue for pre-COVID and dark blue for post-COVID. For income, homeowners with a mortgage had a pre-COVID value of approximately 0.4 and a post-COVID value slightly higher, around 0.45. Homeowners without a mortgage had similar values, with a slight increase post-COVID. Renters had a pre-COVID value of about 0.45 and a post-COVID value slightly above 0.5. For housing wealth, homeowners with a mortgage saw a significant increase from pre-COVID to post-COVID, with values rising from about 0.4 to 0.55. Homeowners without a mortgage also saw an increase, from about 0.1 to 0.15. Error bars are present, indicating variability or uncertainty in the data.
**Summary**: The chart illustrates changes in income and housing wealth for different groups from pre-COVID to post-COVID periods. Homeowners with mortgages and renters experienced increases in income, while housing wealth increased notably for homeowners with mortgages. Homeowners without mortgages saw a smaller increase in housing wealth.

#### Box 2. How Have Higher Interest Rates Affected U.S. Corporates?

Unlike in previous monetary tightening episodes, net interest payments made by U.S. corporates actually
halved (as a share of GDP) even as the federal funds rate moved higher (past cycles had typically seen a
broadly proportional increase in net interest payments). Firm-level data (from Capital IQ) shows this
decline to be common across most sectors, but with more pronounced declines for companies in
manufacturing, transportation, and information technology. This decline in net interest payments has
been a combination of (i) higher corporate cash balances and (ii) more long duration, fixed rate liabilities
so that, as the policy rate moved higher, interest income rose but interest expenses were little changed.
As an illustration, if firms' cash-to-asset ratio had remained at pre-pandemic average levels, corporate net
interest costs would have been around one third higher than was actually recorded.

The negative correlation between the policy rate and firms' net interest costs has had important
consequences for monetary transmission and the real economy. Since 2020, firms with high levels of cash
holdings increased their capital spending and hired more workers relative to similar firms with lower
levels of cash1. This suggests that both corporate investment and hiring were insulated from the increase
in the federal funds rate (and broader tightening of financial conditions) due to the build-up of corporate
cash balances that occurred during the pandemic.

### Box 3. Has Monetary Transmission Changed?1

In March 2022, the Federal Reserve began the fastest and largest series of interest rate hikes since the early
1980s. At the start of the tightening cycle, many expected a contraction in output and higher
unemployment. However, despite a larger-than-expected increase in the policy rate, output and
employment both outperformed.

To disentangle this question of whether the federal funds rate was less impactful in dampening demand (or
whether other countervailing shocks have offset the monetary effects), a model was estimated on pre-
pandemic data to determine how surprise changes in interest rates-triangulated by estimating from equity
and bond market pricing in short windows around Federal Reserve meetings and speeches-impact the
economy. This dynamic structure was then used to back out the monetary policy shocks that would have
been consistent with the activity and inflation outturns that were subsequently seen post-pandemic
(assuming no change in monetary transmission). These implied shocks were then compared with the actual
measured shocks and used as a test of whether the monetary transmission had changed post-pandemic.
This approach explicitly accounts for the possibility that non-monetary shocks are also simultaneously
affecting outturns (even though those shocks are not directly observable).

The results show that between February and July 2022 (around the time the Federal Reserve started to shift
its approach on monetary policy), the impact of rate increases on the macro-economy appeared to be
considerably weaker than it had been pre-pandemic. This implies that larger interest rate increases would
have been necessary during that period to generate similar downward pressure on activity and inflation as
would have occurred in the pre-pandemic period. The lower impact of higher policy rates can partly explain
why demand was more robust in the pandemic recovery despite the abrupt monetary tightening that took
place. Evidence after the initial phase of tightening suggests, though, that the transmission of policy was
broadly consistent with the pre-pandemic period.

2024/129.


## B. How Has Supply Responded?


### 7. The U.S. has seen important supply gains in the past few years from a significant

inflow of foreign-born labor (Box 4). In the past three years, new immigrants have expanded the
labor force by 4.6 million workers (almost 3 percent of the labor force). This represents a significant
acceleration from the 1.7 million increase in foreign-born workers that took place in the three years
prior to the pandemic. These workers have been concentrated in relatively lower income jobs which

<!-- PageFooter="INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND" -->
<!-- PageNumber="11" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="UNITED STATES" -->

had experienced the greatest supply-demand imbalances in the labor market (and where wages
were going up fastest). Immigration appeared, therefore, to have been an important factor in
alleviating labor shortages and moderating wage growth, particularly at the lower end of the income
distribution.


## 8. Labor force participation responded positively to the strong demand for workers.

Rising wages and a tight labor market (as
exemplified by the rapid decline in unemployment
and the high levels of quits, hires, and job
openings in 2021-22) led to a strong rebound in
labor force participation, particularly among
female, black and Hispanic workers. Participation
by prime age workers is now at levels not seen
since the early 2000's and the overall participation
rate is just shy of its 2019 levels. However, the
pandemic-induced decline in participation by
older, more educated workers appears to be a
more permanent change.


## 9. In contrast with weaker productivity outturns in the Euro Area, U.S. productivity was back to its pre-pandemic trend by late 2023.

There have been multiple forces at work in
supporting productivity over the past few years
although it is too early to have a clear view on their
order of importance (Box 5):

**DetailedDescription**: The chart shows the labor force participation rate from January 2019 to April 2024 for three different groups: Total (ages 25-54), Female (ages 25-54), and 55 years and over. The participation rate for the Total group starts at around 82% in January 2019, dips sharply in mid-2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and then gradually recovers to about 83% by April 2024. The Female group follows a similar pattern, starting at about 76%, dipping in mid-2020, and recovering to around 77% by April 2024. The 55 years and over group, plotted on the right-hand side (RHS) axis, starts at about 40%, drops significantly in mid-2020, and fluctuates around 39% thereafter.
**Summary**: The labor force participation rate for individuals aged 25-54 and females aged 25-54 shows a recovery trend post the COVID-19 pandemic dip in mid-2020, reaching near pre-pandemic levels by April 2024. The participation rate for those aged 55 and over shows less recovery, remaining below pre-pandemic levels.

. The resolution of the various supply chain restrictions that were present, particularly in the
goods sector, as the economy reopened.

· Strong private-sector investment which, in turn, has been driven by various forces including a
need to alleviate binding capacity constraints, substitute capital for scarce labor, increase the
resilience and depth of supply chains, accommodate shifts in the demand for electric vehicles
and other green technologies, and take advantage of the investment incentives embedded in
the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act.

. An ongoing boost to public infrastructure investment from the Infrastructure Investment and
Jobs Act.

· A broad-based reallocation of workers across the economy, catalyzed by the pandemic, which
improved employer-employee job matches and incentivized firms to more efficiently utilize
workers' human capital.

· A burst in new business formation.

# Box 4. The Facts on Immigration Inflows

As the economy re-opened after the pandemic, immigration
inflows picked up sharply (CBO estimates 2.7 million new
immigrants arrived in 2022 and 3.3 million in 2023). The increase
was driven by higher inflows of undocumented individuals (the
inflow of refugees and those with visas or green cards has been
broadly in line with past years). The CBO projects a further
sizable addition to the labor force from new immigrants of
around 2.5 million persons per year in 2024-26.1 Since end-2019,
foreign-born workers have accounted for all of the growth in the
labor force. Across counties, a higher share of foreign-born
persons in the working age population has been generally
associated with faster job growth.

The net immigrant inflows in the U.S. were exceeded only by
those in Australia and the U.K. The low level of unemployment
in the U.S. has facilitated the rapid absorption of these workers
into the labor market.

especially, construction). Wages of new immigrants are typically well below those of both native-born
workers and immigrants that have at least two years in the country. This suggests that the presence of these
new workers helped moderate wage growth in these sectors.

Box 5. The Post-Pandemic Shifts in Productivity1

The pandemic and associated shutdowns led to large
swings in aggregate productivity. Initially, this was a
composition effects (as output shifted between high and
low productivity sectors). As the economy reopened,
within industry productivity increases became the main
driver. Around one third of the increase in labor
productivity since 2020 was due to higher total factor
productivity.

An industry-level panel regression points to several
forces behind the post-pandemic rise in productivity:

· Investment in intellectual property products
(IPP) increased during the pandemic. The association of high IPP investment with productivity
growth was particularly strong for information technology and manufacturing.

· Greater dynamism in the labor market through an increase in job-to-job reallocations that was
catalyzed by the pandemic and led to improved employer-employee matches which, in turn, boost
TFP. The increase in labor reallocation from 2020-23 can explain more than 80 percent of the
cumulative increase in labor productivity over that period.

· Increased new business formation, a notable structural shift since the pandemic, should also boost
labor productivity in the future.

These encouraging productivity dynamics have persisted throughout 2023 although it is too early to tell how
sustained they will be going forward.

# IMPLICATIONS FOR THE OUTLOOK AND FOR MONETARY POLICY

10\. Continued robust demand, ongoing supply side gains, and the carryover from the
acceleration in activity in 2023H2 are expected to result in annualized growth of 2.6 percent
in 2024. Despite these tailwinds, the economy is expected to slow in sequential terms, lowering the
2024Q4/Q4 growth rate to close to the growth in potential output. Unemployment is expected to
gradually rise to around 41/4 percent by mid-2025.


## 11. PCE inflation fell from its peak of 7.1 percent in mid-2022 to 2.7 percent in April 2024. Dynamics varied across the various components of the consumption basket:

. After the rapid rise in first auto and then
energy prices in 2021, goods prices
abruptly leveled off in mid-2022 and
have since contributed little to
sequential headline and core inflation.

· Shelter inflation rose rapidly throughout
2022-23 but over the past several
months has been falling, albeit at a
somewhat slower-than-expected pace.


<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: (y/y, percent)
**ChartType**: area
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Inflation
**DetailedDescription**: The chart shows the year-over-year percentage change in three components: Other core services, Shelter, and Core goods, from January 2019 to January 2025. The data is presented as stacked areas, with each component contributing to the total percentage change. The chart starts with a low percentage change in January 2019, with Other core services being the largest contributor. As time progresses, there is a noticeable increase in the percentage change, peaking around January 2022. During this peak, Core goods contribute significantly to the increase, followed by Shelter and Other core services. After the peak, the percentage change gradually decreases, with Other core services remaining the largest contributor by January 2025.
**Summary**: The chart illustrates the year-over-year percentage change in inflation components, highlighting a peak around January 2022 driven by Core goods, followed by a gradual decrease towards January 2025.

past energy price increases (e.g., feeding through to transportation costs). Since 2023, price
increases in services have softened and are now close to, but modestly above, the level implied
by the expected pass-through from wages to prices.8

Overall, the lagged effects of a tight labor market continue to push inflation above target, but this is
being partly offset by a modest deflation in energy costs.

12\. Headline and core PCE inflation are expected to fall to the Federal Reserve's 2 percent
medium-term target by mid-2025, albeit with important upside risks to this path.9 An ongoing
disinflation of shelter costs, near-zero goods inflation, and a slowdown in non-shelter services
inflation should all support a downward path for inflation. Nonetheless, there are important upside
risks. The expected decline in shelter inflation may materialize more slowly or reverse more quickly
than expected. Also, even with the sizable expansion in labor supply described above, nominal wage
growth remains relatively high which could forestall the expected softening of non-shelter services

Paper, 2023.

could add to energy costs which would subsequently pass-through to wages and core inflation.

**ChartType**: line
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Inflation
**DetailedDescription**: The left chart compares actual versus predicted non-shelter services PCE inflation from 2019 Q1 to 2024 Q1. The actual inflation rate fluctuates, peaking around 2021 Q1 at approximately 4% before declining. The predicted inflation follows a similar trend but diverges notably in 2021 Q1 and 2022 Q1, where predictions are higher than actual values.

The right chart decomposes PCE inflation from 2019 to 2024, showing contributions from various factors: headline shock (energy and other), expectations, labor market tightness, and passthrough. Headline shock energy and other contribute significantly to inflation spikes in 2022 and 2023. Expectations and labor market tightness also play roles, with passthrough having a smaller impact.
**Summary**: The charts analyze PCE inflation trends and decomposition. Actual non-shelter services PCE inflation shows fluctuations with notable divergence from predictions in 2021 and 2022. The decomposition highlights the significant impact of headline shocks, particularly energy, on inflation, alongside contributions from expectations and labor market tightness.

13\. Authorities' views. The U.S. economy is performing well with the strongest labor market
that the country has seen in the past 50 years. While activity data in the first quarter was weaker
than in 2023, this did not fully reflect the strong underlying growth in consumer demand and private
capital formation. Inflation continues to fall back to more normal levels and there is little sign that
the U.S. economy is overheated, although growth is expected to slow moderately from the very fast
pace seen in 2023. The high cost of living and the increases in poverty seen in the most recent
(2022) data are important concerns, but the administration has made policy proposals, notably in
the context of the President's FY2025 Budget, to address these problems (including by reducing
healthcare costs, making housing more affordable, increasing Pell grants for lower income college
students, relieving the burden of student debt for middle and lower-income households, expanding
free community college, and restoring the child tax credit expansion).

14\. Given the upside risks to inflation, the Fed should wait to reduce its policy rate until at
least late 2024. The current forward guidance-of having a policy rate that returns to close to
neutral by 2026-appears consistent with PCE inflation returning to the Fed's 2 percent medium-
term target by mid-2025. However, with the economy operating modestly above full employment 10
and with salient upside risks to inflation, risk management considerations argue for delaying the
start of the loosening cycle until the data shows more clarity that inflation is firmly returning to the
FOMC's 2 percent goal. This is borne out by a range of model simulations (Box 6) and is consistent
with the median policy path in the June Summary of Economic Projections. If upside risks to inflation
materialize in the coming months, serious consideration may have to be given to removing the

10 Current estimates based on Blagrave et al. suggest that the economy is currently operating around 1/2 percent
above potential with the potential growth rate over the next few years expected to be around 2.1-2.2 percent. This
approach uses a multivariate filter to model potential output as driven by a combination of permanent shocks to its
level and transitory but persistent shocks to its growth rate. The output gap is then linked to inflation via labor
market slack.

loosening bias in Fed communications and, potentially, even further raising the federal funds rate.
Once policy loosening is underway, the next challenge will be to assess where the neutral policy rate
is likely to be. This will be complex given potential changes triggered by the pandemic. Policymakers
will, therefore, need to be attentive to the behavior of employment and inflation as rates approach
neutral levels and use that incoming information to better triangulate the appropriate medium-term
policy setting.

15\. Continuing to clearly communicate the FOMC's interpretation of incoming data, and
adjusting forward guidance accordingly, should ensure that needed shifts in the monetary
stance are well understood and smoothly absorbed. Communications should continue to
underscore that the FOMC's guidance is not set in stone and that actual policy decisions will (and
should) depend critically on incoming data. To strengthen the communications toolkit, the Federal
Reserve could begin publishing, at each policy meeting, an internally-consistent economic
projection and rate path-produced by Fed staff and potentially endorsed (or otherwise recognized)
by the FOMC. This central forecast could be supplemented with a few alternate, quantified scenarios
to show the range of views on the FOMC and the distribution of risks around the baseline. Such a
communication device would be preferable to the current reliance on the quarterly Summary of
Economic Projections to convey FOMC members' expectations of policy and the macro outlook.

16\. The ongoing shrinking of the Fed's balance sheet is not expected to have a salient
impact on inflation or employment in the months ahead. Nonetheless, there are important
uncertainties surrounding the right level of reserves that would be consistent with an ample reserves
operating regime (Box 7). As such, the May decision to reduce the speed of balance sheet run-off
should help to more slowly tighten liquidity conditions and provide more time for policymakers to
assess the impacts of a smaller balance sheet. The decision on when to stop the shrinking of the
balance sheet will need to be handled carefully so as to prevent inducing volatility in short-term
funding markets.

17\. Authorities' views. The economy has made good progress toward maximum employment
and stable prices but there is still some way to go. Inflation has fallen, particularly during the second
half of 2023, but inflation is still too high and greater confidence needs to be gained that inflation is
moving sustainably toward 2 percent before it is expected that it will be appropriate to reduce the
target range of the federal funds rate. Policy is viewed as being restrictive which is helping to put
downward pressure on activity and inflation. As yet, there are few signs of a material change in the
transmission of monetary policy. Policymakers are carefully attuned to incoming data, the evolving
outlook and the balance of risks in determining the course of policy and will continue to
communicate clearly their assessment of the data and the implications for policy. While it seems
unlikely at this point that there will be a need to further raise the policy rate, policy decisions will be
taken meeting-by-meeting based on the totality of the data. The reduced pace of decline in the
Federal Reserve's securities holdings will allow the balance sheet to shrink to its ultimate level more
gradually, reducing the possibility of stress in money markets as the system approaches the
appropriate level of ample reserves.

# Box 6. Possible Paths for the Federal Funds Rate

Simulations from the Fed's semi-structural FRBUS model show that a range of potential paths for the federal
funds rate would be consistent with PCE inflation returning to 2 percent during 2025. Optimal rate paths are
derived based on:


## (i) different policy objectives:

· A baseline objective function that minimizes the
sum of squared deviations of inflation from the
2 percent target and of unemployment from
NAIRU.

· An asymmetric objective on unemployment only
insofar as it is below NAIRU (consistent with the
Fed's current framework).

· An objective function that puts zero weight on the
unemployment gap.

The asymmetric employment objective tracks closely the
Fed's "dots" in 2024-26, with a lowering of the policy rate
only once inflation is decisively heading back to target.


## (ii) different parameterization of FRBUS:

· A Phillips curve that is ten times steeper than in
the baseline.

· Inflation expectations that are formed with half as
much inertia.

· An elasticity of domestic demand to interest rates
that is 10 percent smaller than in the baseline.

Not surprisingly, a steeper Phillips curve or more responsive inflation expectations would result in a faster
disinflation. This would, in turn, allow for a more front-loaded reduction in the policy rate. On the other
hand, if domestic demand is less sensitive to higher interest rates, then monetary policy would need to
remain tighter throughout the next few years, with the first reduction in the policy rate being deferred until
the first half of 2025.

## Box 7. The Longer Term Size of the Fed's Balance Sheet

To shine a light on what would be a reasonable range
for the target level of the Fed's balance sheet that
ensures a smooth implementation of the ample
reserves regime, a nonlinear reserve demand curve was
estimated based on weekly data during 2009-24.1
Relative to the pre-pandemic period, the most recent
data points to an outward shift in the reserve demand
curve toward higher levels of bank reserves as a share
of GDP.

Drawing on this estimated demand for reserves and
the historic pattern of stochastic shocks around that
demand curve, a target level of reserves was chosen to
ensure that the supply of reserves is sufficiently large so
as to reduce the probability-to 25 (10) percent2-that
shocks to liquidity would cause a 5bps or larger gap
between the interest rate on reserve balances and the
effective federal funds rate. Achieving this outcome would
require a supply of reserves of US$2.1 (3.2) trillion.

**DetailedDescription**: The chart titled 'Estimated Reserve Demand Curve' shows the relationship between the excess reserves plus overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRP) as a percentage of GDP and the difference between the effective federal funds rate (EFFR) and the interest on reserve balances (IORB). The x-axis represents the excess reserves plus ON RRP as a percentage of GDP, ranging from 0 to 25. The y-axis shows the difference between EFFR and IORB, ranging from -0.3 to 0.2 percent. The chart includes observations from three periods: 2009-2012, 2013-2019, and 2020-2024, represented by different colored dots (gray, black, and red respectively). The curve shows a downward trend, indicating that as excess reserves increase, the difference between EFFR and IORB decreases.
**Summary**: The 'Estimated Reserve Demand Curve' illustrates how the difference between the effective federal funds rate and the interest on reserve balances changes with varying levels of excess reserves as a percentage of GDP. The curve suggests that higher excess reserves are associated with a smaller difference between EFFR and IORB, with data points from 2009 to 2024 showing this trend.

period and the cash management complications created
by a periodically binding debt ceiling). As such, the Fed would need a "cushion" of around US$750 billion to
the balance sheet to accommodate increases in the TGA. Furthermore, currency demand has grown
alongside the nominal increase in GDP and currency in circulation is expected to be around US$2.4 trillion by
end-2024. Finally, reverse repo agreements with foreign official accounts are likely to remain at around
US$350bn, a similar level as a share of GDP as prior to the pandemic.

All in all, it would seem like a balance sheet of US$5.6-6.7 trillion would be consistent with an ample reserves
regime that avoids undue volatility in short-term interest rates. At end-May, the balance sheet was US$7.3
trillion and, based on current monthly redemption caps, the balance sheet would be expected to reach the
upper end of this range by the first quarter of 2025.

1 Reserve demand estimation is based on Chen, Z., Kourentzes, N., Veyrune R. M. (2023) "Modeling the Reserve Demand
to Facilitate Central Bank Operations", IMF Working Paper No. 2023/179. The estimation treats bank reserves and the
overnight reverse repo as close substitutes and controls for the level of M2, the VIX, the inflation rate, the 10-year UST
yield, the sovereign credit default swap rate for the U.S., and the USD/EUR exchange rate, forward rate, and exchange
rate implied volatility.

2 This is in the spirit of the advice in Gagnon and Sack (2019) to "steer well clear" of the minimum level of reserves.
Copeland, Duffie and Yang (2021) suggest a different approach to measuring reserve ampleness focusing on the largest
repo-active bank holding companies. It is worth also noting that the introduction of the standing repurchase (repo)
facility in July 2021 could imply a smaller balance sheet is needed than is estimated here (although there is no historical
experience to identify the potential impact of this facility on reserve demand and interest rate volatility).

# A CHRONIC FISCAL IMBALANCE

18\. The general government fiscal deficit and debt, as a share of GDP, are both projected
to remain well above pre-pandemic forecasts. After the unprecedented fiscal response to the
COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit fell significantly in 2022 as pandemic-related fiscal measures
unwound. However, the deficit rose again in 2023, driven by lower non-withheld income tax
revenues, higher interest costs, new outlays on student loan relief (the net present value of which is
booked in the current fiscal year), and increases in mandatory spending on income security. The
combined effect was a 3.5 percent of GDP

19\. The steady upward path for the public debt-GDP ratio represents a growing risk to the
U.S. and global economy, potentially feeding into higher fiscal financing costs and a growing
risk to the smooth rollover of maturing obligations. Based on standard IMF tools, the risk of
sovereign stress in the U.S. is low, public debt is sustainable, and the government has some fiscal
space (Annex II). Nonetheless, under current policies, the general government debt-GDP ratio is
expected to exceed 140 percent of GDP by 2032 and the general government deficit is expected to
remain around 21/2 percent of GDP above the levels forecast at the time of the 2019 Article IV
consultation. Such chronic fiscal deficits-stemming in large part from growing outlays on health
and social security associated with an aging population-represent a significant and persistent
policy misalignment that needs to be urgently addressed.

20\.
D. The large fiscal deficit is also putting upward pressure on the current account deficit.
The 2023 current account was 0.7 percent of GDP larger than the norm (Annex III) with almost all of
the difference being accounted for by a larger-than-desirable fiscal deficit. The impact of the fiscal
dissaving on the external position in 2023 is, though, being partially offset by an increase in
corporate net saving arising from higher after-tax profits (see below) and a modest decline in
corporate investment as a share of GDP.

22\. Achieving the needed realignment of the fiscal position will require going beyond
finding efficiencies in discretionary, non-defense federal spending (which makes up only
15 percent of total federal outlays). Instead, the burden of adjustment will need to be borne by
progressive increases in the federal tax burden and a rebalancing of entitlement programs (notably
social security and Medicare). A range of policy options-some of which are already included in the
president's budget proposal-are outlined in Box 8. Putting these measures in place will, though,
necessitate taking difficult political decisions over the course of multiple years.

23\. Some of the fiscal savings from these efforts should be deployed to increase spending
on programs to alleviate poverty. This should include reinstating a more generous, fully
refundable Child Tax Credit and raising the income threshold for eligibility for the EITC for workers
without children. These programs have already proven the important impact they can have on
poverty outcomes-particularly for children-but they should be more carefully targeted to lower
income households. Expanding such social assistance would be particularly important if there were
to be an increased reliance on indirect taxes.

24\. The proposed medium-term adjustment would be expected to have a relatively small
effect on U.S. growth. If much of the adjustment can take place through higher indirect taxation,
accompanied by improvements in the social safety net and gradual changes to entitlement
programs, the multipliers would be expected to be relatively small. Also, any drag to growth would
be partly offset by somewhat lower interest rates-from both a lower path for the policy rate and
smaller term premia-as well as a somewhat weaker dollar. By reducing fiscal vulnerabilities,
lowering interest rates, and weakening the dollar, the adjustment would create positive outward
spillovers, particularly for countries with sizable dollar financing needs.

25\. The upcoming expiration of provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides an
opportunity to engage in a broader societal discussion about tax reform and the need for

<!-- PageFooter="INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="UNITED STATES" -->

additional sources of revenue. 11 Provisions such as the reduction in the top individual income tax
rate (from 39.6 to 37 percent), the deduction of 20 percent of qualified business income for pass-
throughs (i.e., partnerships, sole proprietors and S-corporations), and the higher minimum threshold
for the estate and gift tax should all be allowed to expire as scheduled. However, the increase in the
standard deduction and limits on itemized deductions (for state and local taxes and mortgage
interest) should be maintained as a permanent feature of the personal income tax. This would
increase equity and simplify the tax code. Consideration could also be given to allowing for the
permanent full expensing of a range of corporate capital spending. In the event that some of the
revenue-losing provisions are renewed, they should be offset with other measures that raise
revenues by a comparable amount.

26\. There should be an effort to address the shortcomings in fiscal institutions that
periodically lead to political stand-offs over the debt limit and the funding of the federal
government. These create systemic risks to the U.S. and global economy that are entirely avoidable.
Institutional changes should be designed to ensure that, once appropriations are approved, the
corresponding space is added automatically to the debt ceiling. Similarly, in situations where the
funding of federal agencies lapses because of an inability to approve appropriations, provisions
should be made to automatically fund the federal government at some fraction of previous year's
funding until a full-year appropriations bill can be signed into law.

27\. Authorities' views. Even with enactment of the CHIPS Act, the Infrastructure Investment
and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, the administration has lowered the federal deficit by
over US$1 trillion and has enacted policies to raise revenues including through sizable investments
in modernizing the Internal Revenue Service, a minimum tax on the profits of the largest
corporations, and a surcharge on stock buybacks. The President's 2025 Budget has proposed
measures to reduce the federal deficit by an average of around 1 percent of GDP over the next
decade, including by raising the corporate tax rate and increasing the tax burden for those earning
over US$400,000 per year. The budget also made the case to make permanent an expanded
refundable Child Tax Credit and a more generous EITC for workers without dependents. While
persistently higher long-term interest rates could create a challenge to debt sustainability, the
administration is committed to maintaining a credible and sustainable fiscal path that stabilizes the
real net interest burden as a share of GDP. The repeated bouts of debt limit standoffs and possible
government shutdowns represent an unnecessary economic headwind and have the potential to
seriously harm business and consumer confidence.

11 Staff's fiscal forecast assumes that these provisions will sunset as scheduled. If all of the expiring provisions of the
2017 Act were to be renewed, this would add around 1.7 percent of GDP to the federal budget deficit (see
Congressional Budget Office).

## Box 8. Options to Lower the Federal Debt

A combination of options will be needed on both the revenue and expenditure side of the budget to bring
the debt-GDP ratio down over the medium term. These include:

· Scaling back poorly targeted tax expenditures. These include not taxing the value of employer-provided
health care, capital gains exemptions for individuals selling their principal residence, and income tax
deductibility for mortgage interest and state and local taxes. Together these tax expenditures account
for around 1.4 percent of GDP per year.

· Closing the "carried interest" provision whereby income earned from partners in an investment fund can
be treated as capital gains and taxed at a 23.8 percent rate (rather than at the 37 percent top marginal
rate).

· Eliminating "step up basis" for capital gains which allows the value of inherited assets to be reset at the
date of death so that any capital gains that has accrued during the life of the original owner are
effectively never subject to capital gains tax.

· Phasing in a federal consumption tax and/or a carbon tax. Such an increase in indirect taxes would
generally be regressive and so would need to be combined with a well-designed social assistance
program to cushion the impact on poor households. As an example, a 10 percent, broad-based VAT
would yield around 2 percent of GDP per year.

· Raising the federal excise tax on gasoline and diesel. The federal tax on gasoline and diesel is not subject
to indexation and has remained unchanged in nominal terms since 1993 (at 18.4 cents for gasoline and
24.4 cents for diesel). Doubling the tax on both gasoline and diesel would yield around 0.15 percent of
GDP per year.

· Raising the corporate tax rate and moving toward a cashflow tax. If combined, such a change in the
corporate tax system could both raise revenue and reduce the marginal disincentive to invest. Each
5 percent increase in the corporate income tax rate would yield around 0.3 percent of GDP per year
(although allowing for full expensing of capital expenditure would backload these potential revenue
gains).

· Reducing imbalances in the social security system. Indexing social security benefits to chained CPI would
save around 0.1 percent of GDP per year. Subjecting earnings greater than US$250,000 to social security
payroll taxes would yield around 0.4 percent of GDP per year.

· Containing health care costs. Technological solutions that increase efficiency, greater cost sharing with
beneficiaries, and changing the mechanisms for remunerating healthcare providers would all help.
Efforts have already been taken for Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices; expanding this
program to a broader range of drugs could save around 0.1 percent of GDP per year.

· Legislating the globally coordinated agreement on a minimum corporate tax. This would help counter
profit shifting and base erosion.

# IS THE U.S. ECONOMY BACK IN BALANCE?

28\. There has been an impressively rapid repair of the economy following the turmoil
caused by COVID-19. As the U.S. emerged from the pandemic there were important concerns
about the potential hysteresis effects arising from declines in labor force participation (particularly
among women, older workers, and lower income households), the tragic loss of life and talent
during COVID, long-term health effects, widespread bankruptcies (particularly among smaller
businesses), and education losses suffered by students. Now, with the benefit of time, it has become
clear that the active deployment of a range of policies during the pandemic has allowed the U.S. to
avoid many of these possible downsides. This is also a testament to the flexibility, dynamism and
innovativeness of the U.S. economic model.

29\. It is difficult to be definitive about whether the U.S. economy is fully back in balance.
Any assessment is complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the degree to which the pandemic
materially changed the underlying steady state (e.g., relative to that which prevailed in 2018-19
when the economy appeared to be close to potential, at full employment, with inflation close to
target, and policy broadly at neutral settings). Also, a number of secular transitions-lower carbon
intensity, greater penetration of digital technologies, different modalities of work, and an aging
population-are underway.

30\. Nonetheless, a stock-taking of the various dimensions of this important question
seems worthwhile as the pandemic moves into the rear-view mirror:

· The signs of supply-demand imbalances in the labor market have mostly dissipated. Levels
of hiring, quits, layoffs, unemployment, measures of labor underutilization (e.g., U6), and the
level of job-to-job transitions have, in broad terms, returned to levels seen in 2018-19. The rate
of employment growth remains very high (2.8 million jobs were created over the past 12
months) but this appears to be consistent with recent sizeable inflows of foreign-born labor.
While the job opening rate is modestly above pre-pandemic levels, structural changes in the
hiring process (notably the increased recourse to electronic platforms) meant that the openings
rate had an upward trend even prior to the pandemic. This would imply the economy will settle
at a somewhat higher rate of job openings than prevailed in 2019. Finally, nominal wage growth
remains above levels consistent with 2 percent inflation. However, due to strong productivity,
the recent growth in unit labor costs has actually been at lower rates that were seen in 2018-19.
Furthermore, the post-pandemic increase in corporate margins (see below) suggests that there
is space for real wages and the labor share of income to rise without an increase in inflation.

. The share of consumption accounted for by goods remains above pre-pandemic levels. The
pandemic triggered a marked shift in consumer demand from services to goods that has
subsequently reversed. However, even prior to 2020 there was an ongoing increase in the
relative share of goods in consumption-particularly durables-driven by rising incomes and a
secular decline in the relative price of goods versus services. After accounting for this prior trend,
it appears that the swing back from goods to services consumption is largely complete.

. Poverty rates are high but have broadly
returned to levels prevailing prior to the
pandemic. The extraordinary interventions
during the pandemic were successful in not only
preventing an increase in poverty but actually
significantly lowering the poverty rate (to
7.8 percent, 5.2 percent for children). With the
expiration of these support measures in 2022,
poverty rose and is now back to levels that are
similar to those seen prior to the pandemic.


<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Percentage of People in Poverty
**ChartType**: line
**TopicKeywords**: Economics, Public policy, Social issues
**DetailedDescription**: The line chart shows the percentage of people in poverty from 2015 to 2022, with separate lines for overall poverty and child poverty. Overall poverty starts at around 13.5% in 2015, decreases gradually to about 10.5% in 2019, drops sharply to approximately 9% in 2020, and then further to around 7% in 2021, before rising again to about 11% in 2022. Child poverty begins at around 16% in 2015, follows a similar decreasing trend to about 11% in 2019, drops significantly to around 5% in 2021, and then increases sharply to about 12% in 2022.
**Summary**: The chart illustrates a general decline in both overall and child poverty rates from 2015 to 2021, with a notable drop in 2021. However, both rates increased significantly in 2022, with child poverty showing a more dramatic rise.

. The external position is broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex III). While the current account deficit (at 3 percent
of GDP in 2023) is somewhat above the norm, this is largely due to the effects of a larger-than-
desirable fiscal position. Similarly, while the U.S. dollar is around 10 percent above its pre-
pandemic levels, these gains can largely be accounted for by the strong cyclical position of the
U.S. and improvements in the terms of trade (as the U.S. has become a net energy exporter). A
medium-term fiscal consolidation-undertaken by both the U.S. and its trading partners-would

be expected to bring the current account even closer to its medium-term norm and modestly
weaken the dollar.

. The real policy rate is well above neutral. With inflationary pressures remaining a concern, it
is appropriate for the ex ante real federal funds rate to be above estimates of the neutral policy
rate (although there is significant uncertainty about what the neutral rate will be once inflation is
decisively back at 2 percent). However, it is expected that the gap between the policy rate and
estimates of neutral will diminish in the coming months as inflation falls back to 2 percent.

over the past few years also catalyzed a repricing of outputs that allowed firms to also build

going to return to pre-pandemic levels. Increasing market power could underpin a permanent
widening of margins. On the other hand, competitive pressures and the entry of new firms may,
over time, push margins lower. Also, if high interest rates persist, firms will increasingly face
higher net debt outlays as they refinance maturing debt.

households reluctant to move and give up their low, fixed-rate mortgage).12 As supply
constraints bind and interest rates fall, construction and turnover should both pick up.
Nonetheless, the increase in the relative price of shelter may well be a lasting feature of the
post-pandemic economy. If that proves to be true, in the coming years we should expect to see
a decline in rates of home ownership (and increase in rentals), slower rates of household
formation, and a shift of demand toward smaller homes. Younger and lower-income households
would be most affected by these trends.

. The public debt and deficit, as a share of GDP, are larger than prior to the pandemic. The
general government deficit is expected, over the medium-term, to remain around 21/2 percent of
GDP higher than prior to the pandemic (split evenly between higher interest payments and a
looser primary balance). The public debt-GDP ratio is also well above levels expected just a few
years ago. This worsening of the fiscal position is perhaps the most visible and lasting imbalance
caused by the various policies undertaken during the pandemic. When combined with a likely
increase in financing costs (e.g., relative to the very low interest rates of the 2010's), the upward
shift in debt and deficits is particularly troubling. As discussed above, developing a clear strategy
for reducing the debt and deficit over time will be essential. Such an adjustment would likely
lead to lower interest rates, a weaker currency, and a CA deficit that is closer to the medium-
term norm.

31\. All in all, the evidence suggests the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance.

Many of the imbalances that were catalyzed by the pandemic have unwound (notably with respect
to labor markets, the composition of consumption, and the external position). Inflation is expected
to soon return to target which will subsequently allow the monetary stance to normalize. There is
significant uncertainty surrounding the prospects for corporate profitability and the relative price of
housing. However, the fiscal deficit remains much too large and will require decisive policy efforts to
address (see above). Addressing this fiscal imbalance through higher indirect taxes, increased
taxation of high-income individuals, eliminating poorly targeted tax expenditures, and making
gradual parametric changes to entitlement programs should be expected to have relatively small
multiplier effects. However, such a change in the policy mix would allow for lower public debt-GDP,
a smaller CA deficit, and would put downward pressure on market interest rates. As such, it would
lessen macroeconomic vulnerabilities and create positive outward spillovers (particularly to those
with sizable dollar financing needs).

2\. Authorities' views. Significant progress had been made in returning the economy to
balance after the extraordinary shocks experienced with the pandemic and the Russian invasion of
Ukraine. Based on a range of indicators, labor supply and demand had come into better balance
over the past year. Supply chain disruptions had been largely resolved. Inflation is on a downward
path and is expected to soon return to more normal levels. The child tax credit contained in the
administration's budget proposal, if enacted, would be an impactful tool to reduce poverty. Finally,
supply side reforms, including those legislated in the Inflation Reduction Act, Infrastructure,

## Political Risks

34\. The upcoming national elections create significant uncertainties about the economic
policy mix that would be pursued in 2025 and beyond. It is possible that the US could see
changes in fiscal policy (both on taxation and spending), financial and environmental regulations,
immigration and trade policies. Depending on the combination of policies, there could be significant
effects on growth, inflation, interest rates, and debt dynamics. This could have varied spillover
effects across countries. For example, in the case of a stronger dollar and more trade restrictions,
countries with large current account deficits, that are reliant on dollar financing, or whose exports
are dependent on the U.S. market, would likely face the largest negative outward spillovers.


## Financial Stability Risks

35\.
Overall, financial stability risks have diminished since the time of the 2023 Article IV
but important pockets of vulnerability remain. Over the past year, the financial stability risks
highlighted by the failures of SVB and Signature banks have receded. Outflows from bank deposits
into money market funds have been smoothly absorbed. In addition, a process is well underway to
work out the worsening credit quality of office commercial real estate (CRE) debt. On the other hand
(as highlighted in the 2023 Article IV) there is a continuing need to increase the resilience of
nonbank mortgage companies, particularly given the critical role they play in servicing a sizable
share of U.S. mortgages. 13 A range of FSAP recommendations remain to be implemented (Annex V).

### 36. Potential shortcomings in Treasury market functioning-under-stress continue to

represent a systemic risk. Over the past year, the
Treasury market has smoothly absorbed significant
swings in pricing of both the term premium and
future path for the federal funds rate. This has
been good news. Nonetheless, given the U.S.
Treasury market's global status, any potential
malfunction in this market would create globally-
relevant effects, including spilling over into the
dollar funding capacity of global banks.

37\. Conscious of past episodes of an abrupt deterioration in market functioning, the U.S.
authorities formed an interagency working group to examine options to increase the
resilience of this key market. To lessen market vulnerabilities, a Treasury buyback program of off-
the-run securities has been put in place, oversight over key market participants has increased14,
better data is being collected, and rules have been established to expand the scope of central
counterparty clearing for a range of secondary markets. These steps go in the right direction and,
when combined with other proposals (Box 9), should help strengthen the current primary dealer-
based system.

38\. The vulnerabilities in the banking system that came to light in 2023-including failings
in bank supervision and risks created by the regulatory "tailoring" undertaken in 2018-have
not yet been addressed. Public comments were requested on proposed changes to bank capital
requirements based on Basel III standards15 and on a requirement for large, non-GSIB banks to
maintain a minimum amount of long-term debt.16 Internal processes are being updated at the
regulatory agencies, including to more-quickly escalate supervisory concerns. However, concrete
actions to decisively remedy these known vulnerabilities have been lacking.17 Options that had been
floated to strengthen the deposit insurance system 18 have not been acted upon, no changes have
yet been made to bank capital or liquidity requirements, medium-sized banks continue to be subject

14 Proprietary or principal trading firms that assume dealer-like roles will be required to register with the SEC, be a
member of a self-regulatory organization, and be subject to similar regulatory requirements as dealers.

15 The goal of the changes are to simplify risk-based capital requirements, use standardized approaches in modeling
credit and operational risk, and change the measurement of market risk and credit valuation which will extend the
scope of application of Basel III and increase capital requirements for banks.

16 To improve the resolvability of certain larger banking organizations and insured depository institutions that are not
subject to the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity Rule, they would be required to have long-term debt outstanding that
exceeds 6 percent of risk-weighted assets, 2.5 percent of the supplementary leverage ratio, or 2.5 percent of total
consolidated assets (whichever is largest).

17 Earlier this year there was a reminder of vulnerabilities when strains became evident in one mid-sized bank that
had been expanding rapidly and had material weaknesses in its internal controls. This prompted downgrades by
ratings agencies, a reduction in dividends by the bank, an injection of capital by an investor group, and changes in
the Board and management of the bank.

18 See "Options for Deposit Insurance Reform", FDIC (2023). On average, uninsured deposits are around one half of
total system deposits but with significantly higher shares for some banks (including some GSIBs).

to the Fed's supervisory stress test only every other year, and it is unclear the degree to which
supervisory actions are becoming more assertive. To address these vulnerabilities, consideration
should be given to fully implementing the final components of the Basel III agreement, applying
similar regulatory requirements (including annual supervisory stress tests) to all banks with US$100
billion or more in assets, further strengthening supervisory oversight and practices, re-examining the
coverage of deposit insurance, and recalibrating liquidity requirements and liquidity stress tests (to
better take account of the potential for fast-moving deposit outflows and the potential losses that
could be realized when long duration assets are liquidated).


## Box 9. Recent Reforms to the Treasury Market

Over the past year, there have been several reforms to strengthen the resilience of the Treasury market and
improve data:

· A buyback program for off-the-run Treasuries was introduced with a goal of bolstering secondary
market liquidity and improving the Treasury's cash management operations (i.e., during periods of
seasonally high tax receipts buying back securities that mature at times of seasonally high outflows).

. After a phase-in period, required central clearing of secondary market transactions will be expanded to
include (with some exemptions): all repo/reverse repo trades collateralized by Treasury securities with
members of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC); all cash trades between interdealer brokers
and between FICC members and a registered broker-dealer or a government securities broker/dealer.
The rule also requires FICC to collect margin for its members and their customers' transactions
separately.

. Requiring firms that act like dealers-e.g., principal trading firms and private funds that are assessed to
be de facto market-makers in the Treasury market-to register with the SEC, become members of a self-
regulatory organization, and comply with the same regulatory requirements as dealers.

. Broker-dealers that are SEC-registered but were exempt from FINRA membership-because they carried
no customer accounts and conducted their principal trading through a registered broker-dealer-are
now required to join FINRA and report their Treasury transactions to FINRA's Trade Reporting and
Compliance Engine.

. After completing a pilot program and publishing a report on non-centrally cleared bilateral repo, the
Office of Financial Research has proposed a rule establishing ongoing data collection of transactions in
this market.

· FINRA has begun to publish daily aggregate data on Treasury transactions and is collecting data on the
time of transaction at the finest increment allowed by their members' execution systems. FINRA has
begun publishing trade-by-trade data for on-the-run securities at the end of each day.

. Money market funds are required to report additional information about the composition and
concentration of their shareholders that hold 5 percent or more of shares outstanding in each class of
shares. Regulatory disclosures were also increased for large liquidity fund advisers that manage at least
US$1 billion in liquidity and money market fund assets.

39\. A realignment in the CRE market, notably for office space, represents a continuing risk
to asset quality for both banks and nonbanks. CRE loans total around US$6 trillion, of which
around one fifth represents exposure to office space (of this amount, around one half of office CRE
exposure is believed to be held on bank balance sheets). Structural changes in work practices
catalyzed by the pandemic have caused office occupancy rates to decline and for maturing leases to

<!-- PageFooter="INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND" -->
<!-- PageNumber="30" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="UNITED STATES" -->

reset at lower prices. At the same time, the costs of new financing for office properties have risen
steeply. As a consequence, the credit quality of the liabilities associated with office CRE has
deteriorated and there is an ongoing process to restructure this debt. Stress tests suggest that the
potential impact on banks of a significant write-down of CRE loans would be concentrated in
relatively small regional banks (Box 10). However, the combination of a high share of uninsured
deposits and unrealized losses on holdings of longer duration securities and loans represents an
additional channel of vulnerability. If losses on CRE exposures-or potentially on other forms of
bank credit-are sufficiently concentrated, they have the potential to trigger a meaningful outflow
of uninsured deposits. This, in turn, could crystallize losses on bank balance sheets as the banks
liquidate their Treasury and mortgage-backed security holdings, potentially creating financial
stability problems across a broader range of institutions. .

Box 10. Potential Bank Losses from Commercial Real Estate

Banks hold around half of all outstanding
CRE loans, with smaller banks holding a
larger share of their assets in CRE. Top-
down stress tests1 show that losses on CRE
assets could deplete the capital of some
highly exposed banks but these are very
small banks. In particular, 16 banks would
exhaust their tier 1 capital buffer. However,
these banks represent 0.1 percent of
system assets. Losses could, though, be
larger if banks have a greater-than-
assumed concentration of office loans in
their CRE holdings.

Note: Missing risk weighted assets (RWA), mostly banks with less than $1bn total
assets, are proxied by total assets. Banks with less than $1bn total assets don't report
uninsured deposit, and their uninsured deposit is estimated as deposit and
retirement accounts with balances greater than the standard maximum deposit
insurance amount, currently $250,000, minus the portion that is insured.

Assuming CRE losses trigger a full outflow of the bank's uninsured deposit (which would then cause the
affected banks to liquidate their Treasury holdings) would result in broader stress. 558 banks (10 percent of
system assets) would deplete their tier 1 capital buffer. This would include a small number of banks with
over US$100 billion in assets. As such, it is the combination of credit losses and the vulnerability created by a
sizable share of uninsured deposits which would undermine bank capitalization under an extreme stress
scenario.

1 The stress test is conducted on 4641 banks based on 2023Q4 Call Reports, representing 99.8 percent of total bank
assets. Office loans are assumed to constitute 40 percent of total CRE loans and there is a 30 percent default rate and
50 percent recovery rate on such loans (considerably worse than following the 2008-09 recession). The minimum tier 1
requirement is 6 percent (i.e. does not include the GSIB surcharge). Results are similar to Jiang et al., "Monetary
Tightening, Commercial Real Estate Distress, and US Bank Fragility", (2023).


## 40. Efforts have been taken to mitigate potential liquidity risks in money market funds.

Money market funds have expanded rapidly in recent years, both due to the expansion of liquidity in
the system during the pandemic and, more recently, as resources have moved out of bank deposits
in search of higher rates of return. During 2023 alone, US$1.1 trillion moved into money market
funds, with most of this increase appearing to come from household savings. Money market fund
assets are almost 60 percent larger today than prior to the pandemic. To lessen vulnerabilities in this

<!-- PageFooter="INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND" -->
<!-- PageNumber="32" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="UNITED STATES" -->

critical sector, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has increased minimum liquidity
requirements for these funds, required funds to impose liquidity fees if their liquid assets become
sufficiently eroded, and removed the ability of funds to temporarily suspend redemptions (i.e.,
through gates or fees). These efforts should lessen the vulnerability of money market funds to run
dynamics without detracting from the important role they play as intermediaries. The changes are
also likely to lead to a migration of assets away from institutional prime funds to government-only
funds (which already make up over 80 percent of the total). In addition to changes to money market
funds, amended rules have been proposed (but not yet implemented) to improve liquidity risk
management and require swing pricing for open-end funds. However, collective investment funds-
which are estimated to have US$7 trillion in assets, largely in retirement accounts-are exempt from
SEC oversight and not subject to these rule changes. 19 This potentially creates a regulatory gap that
may incentivize resource to migrate from SEC-regulated funds to these collective investment funds
as standards are tightened on money market and open-end funds.

41\. The Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) has taken several steps to improve risk
monitoring and coordination among the various regulators. The council has established a
climate-related financial risk committee that is developing a framework for assessing such risks and
developing risk indicators for banks, insurers, and financial markets. In addition, a risk-monitoring
system has been put in place to assess potential financial stability risks associated with hedge fund
activities. The FSOC has developed a new analytical framework to formalize how to assess and
address financial risks and has provided updated guidance on the procedures whereby the FSOC
may designate nonbanks to be subject to Federal Reserve supervision. Actions have also been
undertaken to address data gaps including as relates to non-centrally cleared bilateral repo
transactions and increased disclosure to the SEC by certain SEC-registered private funds.

42\. Authorities' views. The U.S. financial system has proven itself to be resilient and the U.S.
banking system is, in aggregate, sound and well-capitalized. The appropriate level of bank capital is
being reviewed as part of the implementation of Basel III. Bank regulators are updating their
practices to improve supervisory risk identification, ensure proper escalation of supervisory findings,
and strengthen the process and culture of supervision. Supervisors have been reviewing liquidity risk
management practices among supervised institutions, and have worked with firms to address gaps
in practices, where appropriate, and discount window collateral pre-positioning has increased
substantially over the last year. Supervisors were attuned to remaining vulnerabilities-particularly in
smaller regional and community banks-including those related to exposure to commercial real
estate loans. Recent SEC rules should help reduce structural vulnerabilities in money market funds.
The combination of new SEC rules on central clearing, increased oversight of principal trading firms,
more comprehensive data collection, and the introduction of regular buyback operations could help
improve liquidity of Treasury markets. Finally, the FSOC's new analytical framework for financial
stability risks and updated guidance on its nonbank determinations process will both increase

19 These funds are bank-administered trusts with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency having supervisory
responsibility for their activities. In addition, these funds are subject to minimum standards of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act which requires certain disclosure standards to be met and provides fiduciary
responsibilities for the banks who manage and control the funds' assets.

transparency into how FSOC considers risks irrespective of their source and improve FSOC's ability
to address risks to financial stability.


## Trade Risks

43\. The ongoing intensification of trade restrictions and the increased use of preferential
treatment of domestic versus foreign commercial interests represent a growing downside risk
for both the U.S. and the global economy. The U.S. maintains a range of import tariffs that distort
resource allocation and increase trade costs, including in strategic sectors. For national security
reasons, export controls have been extended on advanced computing chips and a new outbound
investment mechanism will scrutinize certain categories of outbound investments of advanced
technologies. The U.S. has also in place-through the Inflation Reduction Act, the CHIPS Act, and the
Build America, Buy America Act-discriminatory policies that favor domestic producers over
imports.20 Finally, rather than rolling back tariffs, the recent review of the Section 301 tariffs on
imports from China recommended expanding tariffs on certain products, including steel, aluminum,
semiconductors, electric vehicles, batteries, critical minerals, solar cells, ship-to-shore cranes and
medical products. 21 The evidence suggests these tariffs will largely be borne by U.S. firms and, to a
lesser extent, consumers (Box 11). The cumulative impact of these various tariff and domestic
content provisions is to distort trade and investment decisions, disrupt global supply relationships,
and risk triggering retaliatory responses by trading partners. They should be removed.


### 44. Industrial policies in the U.S, and the retaliatory actions they trigger, have the potential to contribute to fragmentation risks.

Since the start of the pandemic, the U.S. has
intensified the use of various forms of preferences
for commercial interests, as have other countries.
For example, between 2009-22, the U.S. put in
place over 3,000 subsidy measures, covering
63 percent of U.S. exports.22 These subsidies
increase exports in targeted products relative to
products that do not receive subsidies, with similar
effects found for the U.S. as in other countries.23 In

20 China has initiated a WTO dispute linked to the domestic content provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act and
there is an ongoing WTO dispute concerning U.S. export restrictions on semiconductors.

21 The USTR found that China continues to maintain technology transfer-related acts, policies or practices that
impose a burden or restriction on U.S. commerce. On the basis of this review, the president has increased the level
and scope of the tariffs. Further section 301 investigations are also underway related to Chinese practices in the
shipbuilding, maritime, and logistics sectors. In addition, President Biden has argued against the proposed sale of
U.S. Steel to a Japanese investor and legislation has been signed into law giving TikTok's Chinese parent company 9
months to either divest from the company or face a national ban.

addition, recent data shows that the introduction of subsidies in either China, the European Union or
the U.S. have, on average, a 74 percent probability of being reciprocated in the same product group
by one of the other trading partners.24 Industrial policies should be confined to specific objectives
where externalities or market failures prevent effective market solutions and, even then, they should
minimize trade and investment distortions, be consistent with international obligations, and avoid
discriminating between domestic and overseas producers. Rather than maintaining a complex
network of preferences and incentives, U.S. competitiveness would be better bolstered through
policies such as investments in worker training, apprenticeships, and infrastructure.

45\. The U.S. should actively engage with all major trading partners to address the core
issues-including concerns over unfair trade practices, supply chain fragilities, and national
security-that risk undermining the global trade and investment system. This would mean
engaging fully with efforts to strengthen the WTO, including through the restoration of a well-
functioning dispute settlement system by end-2024, finding common ground in areas such as tariffs,
farm and industrial subsidies, and services trade, and concluding new WTO-based market-opening
agreements. Negotiations have advanced in some areas including the Indo-Pacific Economic
Framework for Prosperity (with thirteen partner countries) and the Critical Minerals Agreements with
the EU, Indonesia, and the U.K. However, the trade pillar of the Indo-Pacific agreement has yet to be
agreed and benefits may be constrained by a lack of market access commitments. Such trade
initiatives and agreements should be used to advance open and free trade, not as discriminatory
tools that create incentives for fragmentation.

46\. Authorities' views. The goal of the administration's trade agenda is to strengthen the
middle class, ensure inclusive and sustainable economic growth, and deliver benefits to a broad
range of communities, including workers. Steps have been taken to ensure supply chains are more
resilient, reliable, diversified and sustainable, particularly with regard to critical goods and
technologies. National security considerations have led to the use of other tools such as controls on
exports and outbound investment. Following an in-depth review, the USTR determined that Section
301 tariff remedies were needed to combat unfair, non-market policies and practices in China linked
to forced technology transfer and the theft of intellectual property. To encourage China to eliminate
these practices, the U.S. has chosen to both maintain existing tariffs and impose new, carefully
targeted tariffs on strategic sectors. The U.S. continues to maintain channels for dialogue with China
and hopes to encourage a change in a range of practices in China that encourage or facilitate
systemic, non-market policies and practices.

# Box 11. Impact of U.S. Tariffs

In May 2024, the U.S. announced recommendations to maintain Section 301 tariffs that were initially
imposed on China in 2018 and 2019, and to add or increase tariffs for certain products. Evidence on the
impact of these measures shows that tariffs reconfigured supply chains, raised import prices and, overall,
had modest negative effects on the U.S. economy.

U.S. firms and importers bore the brunt of the tariffs imposed on imports from China through a one-for-one
increase in import prices.1 However, the pass-through to retail prices was small with costs apparently
absorbed in corporate margins.

On balance, increased trade restrictions had a negative effect on U.S. welfare. The tariffs negatively impacted
sectors that were exposed to the tariffs (e.g., through imported inputs), reducing export growth (Handley,
Kamal, and Monarch, 2020) and lowering employment in those sectors (Flaaen and Pierce 2019). Overall,
there was an estimated negative effect on U.S. welfare equivalent to 0.1 percent of GDP (Fajgelbaum and
Khandelwal, 2022). Similarly, Boer and Rieth (2024) argue that reversing the 2018-19 tariffs would raise
output by 0.4 percent after three years.

The tariffs have prompted a reconfiguration of supply chains, although links to China remain strong. U.S.
imports from China dropped in sectors exposed to the tariffs, replaced by imports from other countries
(particularly in strategic sectors). However, this may not have reduced reliance on China in U.S. supply chains
as those countries that increased their exports to the U.S., on average, imported more from China (Freund et
al, 2023). Gopinath et al (2024) highlights the emergence of connector countries where greater Chinese
presence-measured either through exports or announced greenfield investments-has been correlated
with higher exports from that country to the U.S.

Retaliation by China amplified the negative impact of the U.S. policies. In response to the 2018-19 tariffs,
China introduced its own restrictions on imports from the U.S., raising tariffs to around 21 percent on almost
60 percent of imports from the U.S. These retaliatory tariffs reduced U.S. employment (Waugh, 2019).
Caceres et al. (2019) assess that a 25 percent uniform tariff on Chinese imports, that is reciprocated by China,
would reduce U.S. output by 0.2 percent.

# VOLUNTARY ASSESSMENT OF TRANSNATIONAL ASPECTS OF CORRUPTION


## 7. The United States25 has continued to bring significant enforcement actions against legal and natural persons and take steps to address its high exposure to foreign bribery risks.

Key risk factors include the size of the economy, scale of outward FDI, leading position in global
trade and financial services, and the large number of companies operating in high-risk jurisdictions
and sectors (e.g., arms and defence equipment, oil and gas, technology, aerospace, medicinal and

25 The United States volunteered to have its legal and institutional frameworks assessed in the context of bilateral
surveillance for purposes of determining whether it: (a) criminalizes and prosecutes the bribery of foreign public
officials; and (b) has an effective AML/CFT system that is designed to prevent foreign officials from concealing the
proceeds of corruption.

pharmaceutical products). 26 In the 2022 Follow-up Report, the OECD Working Group on Bribery
(WGB) highlighted the various steps taken by the authorities to implement the majority of the WGB
Phase 4 recommendations. In particular, the WGB recognized their efforts to enhance the
transparency and efficiency of foreign bribery enforcement, such as by providing information
regarding detection sources, evaluating the effectiveness of the DOJ Corporate Enforcement Policy,
issuing recidivism guidance, and publicizing the extension or completion of non-trial resolutions,
which confirms the country's leading enforcement role within the WGB. However, the authorities
should continue to address the remaining recommendations of the Phase 4 evaluation, including
those calling for enhancing whistleblower protections, further addressing corporate recidivism, and
considering possible alternative ways of collecting data on debarment decisions against businesses
based on foreign bribery (see Annex VII).

48\. The U.S. continues to face risks from illicit proceeds of crime, including corruption. The
2024 national money laundering risk assessment (NMLRA) examines the most significant money
laundering crimes in the U.S., including corruption, which remains among the largest proceeds-
generating predicates.27 The NMLRA highlighted the U.S. government's growing concerns about the
illicit finance risks associated with so-called 'gatekeepers'28 to the U.S. financial system. The U.S. has
identified instances where corrupt foreign officials have used investment advisers as an entry point
to invest in U.S. securities, real estate, and other assets. In response, in February 2024, Treasury
issued two proposed rules that would apply AML/CFT requirements to certain investment advisers
and real estate professionals. Subsequently, in May 2024, FinCEN and the SEC jointly issued a
separate proposed rule that would require certain investment advisers to implement reasonable
procedures to identify and verify the identities of their customers. In addition, the enactment of the
Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) in 2021, and its implementing regulations, is meant to address a
significant and longstanding gap in the U.S.' AML/CFT regime related to beneficial ownership.29 Staff
note that the continued implementation and enforcement of the CTA is important in ensuring that
U.S. companies are not misused for money laundering, corruption, and other illicit financial flows.


# STAFF APPRAISAL


## 49. The U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few years. Hysteresis effects from the pandemic did not materialize and both activity and employment now

26 Out of the 500 largest multinational enterprises (MNE) in the world, 237 are headquartered in the United States,
with many operating in high-risk sectors and jurisdictions, according to the OECD- UNSD Multinational Enterprise
Information Platform.

27 Money laundering methods commonly associated with illicit foreign corruption proceeds include the misuse of shell
companies and other legal entities, cash purchases of real estate and luxury or high-value goods, and virtual assets.

28 These include sectors like attorneys, real estate professionals, trust and company service providers, and investment
advisers that may be involved in forming and managing legal entities, providing financial advice, and structuring
transactions, but that have not been subject to comprehensive or consistent AML/CFT obligations. The misuse of these
'gatekeepers' is a recurring typology associated with the laundering of foreign corrupt proceeds.

29 Certain companies are now required to disclose to Treasury their beneficial ownership information when they are
formed (or, for non-U.S. companies, when they register with a state to do business in the U.S.) or when there are
changes in beneficial ownership.

exceed pre-pandemic expectations. Real incomes were diminished by the unexpected rise in
inflation in 2022 but have now risen above pre-pandemic levels. Job growth has been particularly
fast, with 16 million new jobs created since end-2020. However, income and wealth gains have been
uneven across the income distribution and poverty remains high, particularly following the
expiration of pandemic-era support. The outlook is for continued healthy rate of growth with
balanced risks around the baseline forecast.

50\. The ongoing disinflation has taken a relatively light toll on the economy. PCE inflation
peaked at 7.1 percent in mid-2022, the highest level since the early 1980s. The Federal Reserve
responded by raising the policy rate by 525bps which bolstered policy credibility, provided an
anchor for wages and prices, and helped guide inflation back toward the FOMC's 2 percent goal.
Policymakers were also fortunate that their efforts were accompanied by important supply gains as
supply chains repaired, the labor force expanded, and labor productivity picked up. PCE inflation was
2.7 percent in April and is expected to return to 2 percent by mid-2025. There are, though,
important upside risks to the outlook for inflation.

51\. Migrant inflows have represented an important safety valve to ease supply-demand
imbalances in the labor market and facilitate the ongoing disinflation. The inflow of foreign-
born workers has expanded the workforce by almost 3 percent over the past three years. This has
been accompanied by an increase in participation by the native-born population, particularly female,
black and Hispanic workers. Despite these positive outturns, the growing share of undocumented
workers in the labor pool points to a critical need for the U.S. to put in place a more orderly
approach to immigration.

52\. Despite the important progress in returning inflation towards its 2 percent goal, the
Federal Reserve should wait to reduce its policy rate until at least late 2024. With the economy
humming along at an impressive rate the U.S. has not paid a high cost to current monetary policy
settings (i.e., in terms of slower growth, job losses, or reduced labor force participation). This
provides significant room for maneuver within the Fed's mandate of price stability and maximum
employment. Given salient upside risks to inflation-brought into stark relief by data outturns earlier
this year-it would be prudent to lower the policy rate only after there is clearer evidence in the data
that inflation is sustainably returning to the FOMC's 2 percent goal. Continuing to clearly
communicate the FOMC's interpretation of incoming data, and adjusting forward guidance
accordingly, should ensure that the needed shifts in the monetary stance are well understood and
smoothly absorbed. The decision to reduce the pace of run-off of the Fed's holdings of Treasuries
will usefully provide more time to judge the appropriate long-term size of the Fed's balance sheet.

53\. There is a pressing need to reverse the ongoing increase in public debt-GDP ratio. The
general government fiscal deficit and debt, as a share of GDP, are both projected to remain well
above pre-pandemic forecasts over the medium-term. Such high deficits and debt create a growing
risk to the U.S. and global economy. To put debt-GDP on a clear downward trajectory, a frontloaded
fiscal adjustment will be needed that shifts the general government to a primary surplus of around
1 percent of GDP (an adjustment of around 4 percent of GDP relative to the current baseline). There
are various options to achieve this adjustment over the medium-term including raising indirect

taxes, progressively increasing income taxes (including for those earning less than US$400,000 per
year), eliminating a range of tax expenditures, and reforming entitlement programs. Some of the
fiscal savings from these efforts should, though, be deployed to increase spending on programs to
alleviate poverty.

54\. Financial stability risks have diminished since the time of the 2023 Article IV
consultation and some critical financial sector reforms are being implemented. For example,
welcome steps have been taken to strengthen the functioning of the Treasury market and to better
insulate money market funds from liquidity shortfalls. However, concrete actions have been lacking
in mitigating the banking system vulnerabilities that came to light in 2023. There is a need,
therefore, to fully implement the final components of the Basel III agreement, apply similar
regulatory requirements to all banks with US$100 billion or more in assets (including supervisory
stress tests), further strengthen supervisory oversight and practices, re-examine the coverage of
deposit insurance, and recalibrate bank liquidity requirements and liquidity stress tests to better
take account of the potential for fast-moving deposit outflows. Other pockets of vulnerability-
notably as relates to nonbank mortgage companies and the possible migration of assets to
collective investment funds-also warrant attention.

55\. The ongoing intensification of trade restrictions and the increased use of preferential
treatments for domestic versus foreign commercial interests represent a growing downside
risk to both the U.S. and the global economy. The U.S. should actively engage with its major
trading partners to address the core issues-including concerns over unfair trade practices, supply
chain fragilities, and national security-that risk undermining the global trade and investment
system. Tariffs, nontariff barriers, and domestic content provisions are not the right solutions since
they distort trade and investment flows and risk creating a slippery slope that undermines the
multilateral trading system, weakens global supply chains, and spurs retaliatory actions by trading
partners. These policies are ultimately bad for U.S. growth, productivity and labor market outcomes
and the evidence suggest their costs are largely borne by U.S. firms and consumers. The U.S. should
unwind obstacles to free trade and seek instead to bolster competitiveness through investments in
worker training, apprenticeships and infrastructure.

56\. The evidence suggests that the U.S. economy has largely returned to balance. Labor
markets imbalances have been mostly resolved with the economy now appearing to be operating
slightly above maximum employment. By mid-2025, inflation is expected to return to the FOMC's
2 percent goal which will, in turn, allow the policy rate to return to a neutral setting. The external
position is assessed to be broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies. However, as discussed above, the fiscal deficit is much too large and public debt
is well above prudent levels. Implementing the policy mix proposed in this report would help
preserve macroeconomic balance going forward.

57\. It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

# Annex II. Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Assessment

Following the unprecedented fiscal response to the COVID-19 outbreak, the budget deficit returned to
pre-pandemic levels in 2022, only to be reversed in 2023 mainly due to lower income tax revenue and
increasing interest rates. Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to rise as a share of GDP
over the medium-term as aging-related expenditures on health and social security feed into the debt
dynamics. Gross financing needs are large, albeit manageable given the global reserve currency status
of the U.S. dollar. A credible medium-term fiscal adjustment featuring reprioritization of budget
programs and revenue-gaining tax reform is needed to put public debt on a downward path.
Nonetheless, the risks of debt distress are low, and debt is viewed as sustainable.

1\. Background. An unprecedented level of fiscal expansion was introduced in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an increase in the fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP. The
subsequent fiscal consolidations in 2021-22, as pandemic-related extraordinary measures were
phased out, contributed to narrowing the budget deficit. However, the American Rescue Plan
(enacted in March 2021), the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (enacted in November 2021),
along with the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act (both enacted in August 2022)
slowed the pace of fiscal contraction, while weaker-than-expected income tax receipts widened
fiscal deficits substantially.

2\.
Baseline. The staff's baseline is based on current and likely-to-be-passed laws. Under this
baseline, public debt is expected to rise over the medium-term as age-related spending pressures
on entitlement programs assert themselves. Federal debt held by the public is projected to increase
from about 97 percent of GDP in FY2023 to around 116 percent of GDP by 2033, with general
government gross debt rising from about 121 percent of GDP to 144 percent of GDP over the same
period.

3\.
Adjustment scenario. The general government primary deficit was 4.1 percent of GDP in
2023 and is projected at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2024. Gradually raising the primary general
government surplus over the medium-term to around 1 percent of GDP (1.4 percent of GDP for the
federal government) would put the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path. Staff views this
adjustment as feasible. The target primary surplus would have to be larger to bring the debt ratio
closer to pre-Great Recession levels.

4\.
Debt servicing costs. The debt projections have been adversely affected by the current and
projected deterioration in interest rate- growth differential, despite the safe-haven status of the
United States. Under staff's baseline, the effective nominal interest rate is projected to stabilize at
3.3 percent by 2033 after peaking at 4.0 percent in 2024. Government interest payments are
expected to rise with higher interest rates.

## 5. Long-term risks: health expenditures. Due

to the ongoing aging of the population, public
healthcare expenditures are expected to rise

considerably. The CBO projects net federal spending

on major health care programs to increase from

5.6 percent of GDP in 2024 to 8.3 percent of GDP in

care costs, with the remainder attributed to
population aging. Rising healthcare expenditures will considerably increase deficit and risk of
sovereign stress in the long-term. Increasing efficiency, greater cost sharing with beneficiaries and
changing the mechanism of remunerating healthcare providers will help contain health care cost. As
such, a slower-than-expected growth in health care costs and/or population aging would lead to a
lower-than-projected health spending.

6\.
Long-term risks: Social Security spending. Aging of the population also contributes to
growth in spending on Social Security, particularly in the first decade from now, from 5.2 percent of
GDP in 2024 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2034. According to the CBO, the number of Social Security
beneficiaries is projected to rise significantly by 12 million from 68 million in 2024 to 80 million in
2034. Subsequently, over the following two decades, this upward trend persists, albeit at a slower
pace. By 2054, the beneficiary count is forecasted to grow by an additional 16 million, totaling
96 million beneficiaries, equivalent to 25 percent of the population.

7\.
Realism. Baseline economic assumptions are generally within the error band observed for all
countries. The baseline fiscal projections and implied near-term adjustment are realistic, well within
the median range of adjustment in historical and cross-country
experience.

8\.
Mitigating factors. The depth and liquidity of the U.S.
Treasury market, its safe-haven status, lack of foreign currency
debt, and large institutional investor base represents a
mitigating factor for the high external and gross financing
requirements. While foreign official holdings of U.S. Treasuries
remain stagnant, an increase in the overall foreign ownership,
backed by nonofficial foreign investors, suggests robust
demand and reflects the stability of the Treasury market.

### Debt stabilization in the baseline

No


### DSA Summary Assessment

Commentary: United States is at a low overall risk of sovereign stress and debt is sustainable. Most indicators have started
to normalize as the recovery from the COVID-19 shock has proceeded. However, debt is expected to rise for several years
before stabilizing. Medium-term liquidity risks as analyzed by the GFN Financeability Module are moderate. Over the
longer run, United States should continue with reforms to tackle risks arising from population aging on the social security
fund. However, the long time horizon at which these risks would materialize and the authorities' planned measures will
help contain risks.

Source: Fund staff.

Note: The risk of sovereign stress is a broader concept than debt sustainability. Unsustainable debt can only be resolved
through exceptional measures (such as debt restructuring). In contrast, a sovereign can face stress without its debt
necessarily being unsustainable, and there can be various measures-that do not involve a debt restructuring-to remedy
such a situation, such as fiscal adjustment and new financing.

1/ The near-term assessment is not applicable in cases where there is a disbursing IMF arrangement. In surveillance-only
cases or in cases with precautionary IMF arrangements, the near-term assessment is performed but not published.

2/ A debt sustainability assessment is optional for surveillance-only cases and mandatory in cases where there is a Fund
arrangement. The mechanical signal of the debt sustainability assessment is deleted before publication. In surveillance-only
cases or cases with IMF arrangements with normal access, the qualifier indicating probability of sustainable debt ("with
high probability" or "but not with high probability") is deleted before publication.

Reporting on Intra-Government Debt Holdings

1/ CG=Central government; GG=General government; NFPS=Nonfinancial public sector; PS=Public sector.

2/ Stock of arrears could be used as a proxy in the absence of accrual data on other accounts payable.

3/ Insurance, Pension, and Standardized Guarantee Schemes, typically including government employee pension liabilities.

4/ Includes accrual recording, commitment basis, due for payment, etc.

5/ Nominal value at any moment in time is the amount the debtor owes to the creditor. It reflects the value of the instrument at creation and
subsequent economic flows (such as transactions, exchange rate, and other valuation changes other than market price changes, and other volume
changes).

6/ The face value of a debt instrument is the undiscounted amount of principal to be paid at (or before) maturity.

7/ Market value of debt instruments is the value as if they were acquired in market transactions on the balance sheet reporting date (reference date).
Only traded debt securities have observed market values.

Commentary: The coverage in this SRDSA is for the general government. The cross holdings are cancelled out in the general government data,
and only the cross holdings that were netted out of the public debt calculation are shown in the table.

<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Annex II. Figure 3. United States: Public Debt Structure Indicators
**ChartType**: area
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Government
**DetailedDescription**: The chart titled 'Debt by Currency (Percent of GDP)' shows the proportion of U.S. public debt in foreign currency, local currency, and local-linked currency from 2015 to 2033. The projection indicates an increase in foreign currency debt from 2021 onwards. The 'Public Debt by Holder (Percent of GDP)' chart illustrates the distribution of debt among various holders, including external private creditors, domestic creditors, and domestic commercial banks, from 2014 to 2022. The 'Public Debt by Governing Law, 2023 (percent)' pie chart shows that 100% of the debt is governed by domestic law. The 'Debt by Instruments (Percent of GDP)' chart shows the distribution between marketable and nonmarketable debt from 2015 to 2029, with projections indicating a stable trend. The 'Public Debt by Maturity (Percent of GDP)' chart shows the maturity structure of debt from 2015 to 2029, with projections indicating a gradual increase in the share of debt with maturity greater than 5 years.
**Summary**: The charts provide a comprehensive overview of the U.S. public debt structure, highlighting trends in currency denomination, debt holders, governing law, debt instruments, and maturity. Notably, there is a projected increase in foreign currency debt and a shift towards longer maturity debt.

<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Contribution to Change in Public Debt
**ChartType**: bar
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Public debt
**DetailedDescription**: The chart illustrates the contribution to changes in public debt as a percentage of GDP from 2014 to 2032, with projections starting from 2022. The contributions are broken down into several components: primary deficit, real interest rate and relative inflation, real GDP growth, exchange rate depreciation, other flows, and residual. The primary deficit is consistently positive, contributing to an increase in public debt, while real GDP growth is negative, indicating a mitigating effect on debt. The cumulative contributions over the projection period are shown on the right, with primary deficit contributing 29%, real interest rate and relative inflation 23%, real GDP growth -22%, exchange rate depreciation -25%, other flows 0%, and residual 0%.
**Summary**: The chart shows that public debt does not stabilize over the medium term, primarily due to the ongoing primary deficit. Real GDP growth acts as a mitigating factor, reducing the impact of other positive contributors to debt increase.

<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Annex II. Figure 5. United States: Realism of Baseline Assumptions
**ChartType**: bar
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Debt, Economics, Fiscal policy, GDP, United States
**DetailedDescription**: The figure contains multiple charts analyzing the realism of baseline assumptions for the United States. It includes:

1. **Forecast Track Record**: Shows the public debt to GDP ratio, primary deficit, real GDP growth, exchange rate depreciation, and SFA (Statistical discrepancy) for real-time, t+3, and t+5 periods.

2. **Public Debt Creating Flows**: Displays primary deficit, real GDP growth, exchange rate depreciation, and statistical discrepancy for the years 2019 to 2024.

3. **Bond Issuances**: Illustrates debt issuances in percent of GDP for different maturities (5+ year term, 1-5 year term, and <1 year term) from 2015 to 2024.

4. **3-Year Debt Reduction**: Shows the distribution of 3-year debt reduction with a maximum of 23.6% and a median of 5.9% of GDP.

5. **3-Year Adjustment in Cyclically-Adjusted Primary Balance**: Displays the distribution of adjustments with a maximum of 2.6% and a median of 0.2% of GDP.

6. **Fiscal Adjustment and Possible Growth Paths**: Shows real growth using multiplier effects from 2020 to 2026.

7. **Real GDP Growth**: Displays real GDP growth from 2015 to 2029, highlighting output gaps.
**Summary**: The charts provide a comprehensive analysis of the United States' fiscal and economic assumptions, focusing on debt, GDP growth, and fiscal adjustments. Key takeaways include the historical output gap revisions, bond issuance trends, and the realism of debt reduction and primary balance adjustments. The analysis suggests that the projected fiscal adjustments and debt reduction are within reasonable margins.

<!-- FigureContent="**Title**: Annex II. Figure 7. United States: Long-Term Risk Analysis
**ChartType**: line
**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Economics, Government and policy
**DetailedDescription**: The figure presents a long-term risk analysis for the United States, focusing on projections of the GFNs-to-GDP ratio and the total public debt-to-GDP ratio from 2016 to 2032. The projections are based on different assumptions: medium-term extrapolation, medium-term extrapolation with debt stabilizing primary balance, and historical average assumptions. The risk indication is shown with color codes: red for high risk and green for low risk. The GFNs-to-GDP ratio is projected to decrease from 2016 to 2029 and then stabilize, while the total public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase steadily over the same period. The projections include baseline, baseline with T+5 and DSPB, and custom scenarios. The commentary notes that the long-term amortization module does not trigger an overall risk indication, and long-term projections show a steady increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio and GFNs-to-GDP ratio.
**Summary**: The chart analyzes the long-term fiscal risk for the United States, showing projections for GFNs-to-GDP and total public debt-to-GDP ratios. The GFNs-to-GDP ratio is expected to stabilize after 2029, while the total public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase steadily. The risk indication varies based on different projection assumptions, with some scenarios indicating higher risk than others.

**TopicKeywords**: Business and finance, Demographics, Health
**DetailedDescription**: The figure consists of two line charts comparing different projections of the United States' fiscal metrics related to health demographics. The left chart shows the GFN-to-GDP ratio from 2016 to 2052, with three lines representing different scenarios: Baseline: Custom, Health (Demographics), and Health (Demographics + ECG). The Baseline: Custom scenario shows a peak around 2025, followed by a gradual decline and stabilization. The Health (Demographics) and Health (Demographics + ECG) scenarios show a similar trend but with slightly higher values, especially towards 2052. The right chart displays the Total Public Debt-to-GDP Ratio over the same period, with similar scenario lines. The Baseline: Custom scenario shows a steady increase, while the Health (Demographics) and Health (Demographics + ECG) scenarios show higher ratios, particularly towards the end of the period. The commentary notes that demographic trends project a steady increase in both ratios, and additional excess cost growth (ECG) could result in significantly higher ratios by 2052.
**Summary**: The charts project a steady increase in the United States' GFN-to-GDP and Total Public Debt-to-GDP ratios due to demographic trends. The inclusion of excess cost growth (ECG) in projections results in higher ratios, indicating potential fiscal challenges by 2052.

# Annex III. External Sector Assessment

Overall Assessment: The external position in 2023 was broadly in line with the level implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. An
improvement in the trade balance was led by a decline in the goods deficit, primarily driven by reduced imports of goods, resulting in a current
account (CA) deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP (versus 3.8 percent of GDP in 2022). The CA deficit is projected to decline to about 21/4 percent of GDP
over the medium term based on an increase in net public saving due to fiscal consolidation and a slow convergence of private saving to its steady
state after years of excess saving drawdowns, reflected in a lower trade deficit.

Potential Policy Responses: Over the medium-term, suggested fiscal consolidation aimed at a medium-term general government primary surplus of about 1
percent of GDP should broadly stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio and maintain an external position consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. Structural policies to increase competitiveness while maintaining full employment include upgrading infrastructure; enhancing the schooling, training,
apprenticeship, and mobility of workers; supporting the working poor; and implementing policies to increase growth in the labor force (including skill-based
immigration reform). Industrial policies should remain narrowly targeted to specific objectives where externalities or market failures prevent effective market
solutions and avoid favoring domestic producers over imports. Tariff barriers and other trade distortions should be rolled back, and trade and investment
disagreements with other countries should be resolved in a manner that supports an open, stable, and transparent global trading system.

Foreign Asset
and Liability
Position and
Trajectory

Background. The NIIP stood at -70.7 percent of GDP at end 2023, weakening from -61.2 percent of GDP in 2022 and compared
to the 2016-19 pre-pandemic average of about -461/2 percent of GDP. About a quarter of the NIIP decline was attributed to net
transactions, while the main driver of change was valuation adjustments stemming from a significant rise in U.S. stock prices
compared to foreign stocks which led to an increase in the market value of U.S. liabilities more than U.S. assets. At the same time,
the small depreciation of the U.S. dollar (around 1.7 percent) raised the value of foreign-currency denominated U.S. assets in dollar
terms, thereby marginally offsetting (about 10 percent of) the negative impact of rising stock prices on the NIIP. Under the IMF
staff's baseline scenario, the NIIP is projected to remain broadly unchanged through the medium-term on the back of
improvements in net portfolio investment position as the CA balance reverts to its pre-pandemic average and valuation gains
persist.

Assessment. Despite the widening negative trend in the NIIP, the U.S. external debt declined to around 87 percent of GDP in
2023 (down from its mid-2020 peak of nearly 110 percent of GDP and the 2016-19 average of 94 percent of GDP) driven by a
strong post-pandemic economic rebound. In addition, the investment income balance remained positive as the yield on assets
has consistently surpassed that of its liabilities. Importantly, the substantial share of external assets denominated in foreign
currencies (which has increased to around 70 percent by 2020)-combined with an even larger share of U.S. dollar denominated
external liabilities-remains a relevant channel for exchange rates to affect NIIP through valuation changes, with a depreciation
generally improving the NIIP. Nonetheless, financial stability risk could surface in the form of an unexpected decline in foreign
demand for U.S. fixed-income securities, which is a main component of the country's external liabilities. The risk, which could
materialize, for example, as a result of a failure to reestablish fiscal sustainability, remains moderate given the dominant status of
the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency. Strong institutions, a predictable policy framework, and attractive diverse investment
opportunities further mitigate the likelihood of such risk materializing. About 60 percent of U.S. assets are in the form of FDI and
portfolio equity claims.

In 2023, the trade deficit notably contracted relative to 2022 (-2.8 versus -3.7 percent of GDP), reversing the trend of deterioration observed since 2016 primarily due to a reduced deficit in goods. Additionally, the service surplus increased slightly. Meanwhile, income accounts remained broadly stable. From a savings-investment perspective, the CA deficit reflected the public sector's savings- investment deficit, partly offset by private sector's savings-investment surplus. The CA deficit is expected to gradually decline to about 21/4 percent of GDP over the medium-term.</td>

The EBA REER index model suggests an overvaluation of 8.3 percent, and the EBA REER level model suggests an overvaluation of 16.7 percent.

Data collection from financial companies deemed "covered reporters" began in October 2019. This data collection requires the submission of information by central counterparties with average daily total open repo commitments of at least $50 billion. On May 6, 2024, the OFR promulgated a rule regarding "Ongoing Data Collection of Non-centrally Cleared Bilateral Transactions in the U.S. Repurchase Agreement Market" (part of 12 CFR 1610). Non-centrally cleared bilateral repo (NCCBR) transaction data is the last segment of repo data in the U.S. for which U.S. financial regulators have not had access to transaction-level data. This rule requires certain financial companies to report transaction-level NCCBR data on a daily basis. Companies that meet reporting thresholds have at least $10 billion in average daily total outstanding commitments to extend guarantees on and borrow cash through NCCBR transactions over all business days during the prior calendar quarter. Aggregated data from the cleared repo transaction OFR data collection, together with triparty repo data transaction data collected by the New York Federal Reserve Bank feed into the OFR's Short-Term Funding Monitor, which was launched in 2020. The Short-Term Funding Monitor includes the cleared repo and triparty repo daily preliminary and quarterly final aggregated data series and is available for download by the public via an application programming interface.</td>

JADE is an OFR-hosted platform designed for Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) member agencies to analyze risks to financial stability. JADE is designed to support a wide array of financial stability research by combining public, proprietary and non- public government data in a single platform, accessible to researchers, analysts and support staff within OFR and FSOC member agencies. To facilitate collaborative research, JADE offers scalable, high-performance computing with analytical software and support for programming languages such as R and Python in a cloud-based environment with analysis-ready data. The platform is extensible and will expand as new financial risks are identified and new data becomes available. Because it was identified as a data gap by FSOC, climate-related financial risk is the first use case FSOC identified for JADE. As a result, JADE has been designed with analytical capabilities broader than has been typical of past financial data analytical platforms.

In October 2023, the Board adopted a final regulation implementing the Building Block Approach capital requirement, and the regulation became effective on January 1, 2024. The United States-along with other interested jurisdictions-is developing an Aggregation Method at the IAIS. The NAIC adopted the Group Capital Calculation in 2020 and over half the states now require the GCC to be filed, with all states expected to adopt the GCC by January 1, 2026, when it becomes an Accreditation Standard. The IAIS has developed high-level principles and criteria to assess whether the Aggregation Method provides comparable outcomes to the ICS by the end of the monitoring period. The Board and NAIC believe that the Aggregation Method is comparable to the ICS such that it should be considered by the IAIS and its member jurisdictions to be an outcome-equivalent approach for implementation of the ICS. No U.S. regulator intends to adopt the ICS in its current form.</td>

Rationale for Staff Assessment: Staff assesses the overall data quality to be adequate for Fund surveillance. The economic and monetary statistics from
the FRB, the BEA, and the BLS are comprehensive and of high quality. The dates for main data releases are published well in advance. There is a need to
reconcile the saving-investment balance in the national accounts with the current account balance in the BOP as the discrepancy has widened significantly.
This re-alignment of intersectoral consistency would help with the assessment of external imbalances. In addition, to align with BPM6, trade of goods
should be recorded based on residency; goods imported by nonresident construction companies should be included as goods in the balance of
payments; and values of illegal or smuggled activities should be estimated and included.

Changes since the last Article IV consultation. The authorities have taken steps to further strengthen data collection, e.g., the improvement in financial
market data as listed in Box 9 and Appendix V.

Corrective actions and capacity development priorities. None

Use of data and/or estimates in Article IV consultations in lieu of official statistics available to staff. Staff does not use any data and/or estimates
in the staff report in lieu of official statistics.

Other data gaps. Staff encourages continued efforts to advance financial sector statistics including banks' holdings of CLOs, CRE loan holdings by types
of properties, and linkages to nonbanks.

# Annex VII. Transnational Aspects of Corruption


## Supply-Side of Corruption1

1\.
The OECD WGB commended the authorities' efforts to further enhance the
transparency and efficiency of the enforcement approach and tools, keeping the United
States at the forefront of the fight against foreign bribery. Since the 2020 Phase 4
evaluation, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) have undertaken sizeable enforcement actions against legal persons.
More specifically, at the time of the October 2022 Follow-up Report, the DOJ had resolved
new supply-side enforcement actions regarding at least 11 legal persons in 9 foreign
bribery schemes (imposing $4.7 billion in monetary penalties); while the SEC had brought
at least 13 enforcement actions in relation to 10 schemes (imposing $1.3 billion in civil or
administrative penalties). In addition, both the DOJ and SEC reported their maintenance of
sufficient data on detection sources in foreign bribery matters. Moreover, the DOJ
developed internal guidance on corporate recidivism in its enforcement approach, where
prosecutors are instructed to consider all prior wrongdoing by the company itself and
related corporate entities.2

2\.
The WGB encouraged the United States to continue addressing the Phase 4
recommendations on whistleblowers, corporate recidivism, and data on debarment
decisions. While whistleblowers protections and incentives for issuers who report to the
SEC violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) are commendable as good
practice, whistleblowers who report only to the DOJ or whose reports concern FCPA
violations by non-issuers have very limited protections. While the authorities recognized
that legislative reforms may be required, they did not provide additional guidance on the
variations in protections depending on the agency to which a whistleblower makes a
report. Although DOJ instituted comprehensive guidance regarding recidivism and
publicized such guidance, the WGB recommended that the authorities continue to
enhance public awareness of corporate recidivism's impact on the level of sanctions or the
choice of resolution. Finally, further consideration should be made by the authorities of
possible alternative ways of collecting data on debarment decisions against businesses
based on foreign bribery.

1
"Information relating to supply-side corruption in this annex draws on the WGB's Phase 4 Follow-Up Report of the
United States (October 2022). The IMF staff and the United States have provided additional views and information whose
accuracy have not been verified by the WGB or the OECD Secretariat, and which do not prejudice the WGB's monitoring
of the implementation of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.

2 At the time of the October 2022 Follow-up Report, it remained too early to assess what impact this new guidance
would have in practice, while the SEC had not developed any express guidance.

# Statement by Elizabeth Shortino, Executive Director for the United States, Amy Houpt Medearis, Senior Advisor to Executive Director, and David Wright, Advisor to Executive Director July 17, 2024

We thank the U.S. mission team, led by Nigel Chalk and Mai Chi Dao, for their policy advice
and robust analysis. We broadly concur with staff's assessment of the U.S. economy, which has
proven resilient and continues to see strong growth. We have seen a historic and equitable
economic recovery since the start of the Biden Administration, with an expanding labor force
and low unemployment, rising business investment, and a significant decline in inflation. The
Federal Reserve is adroitly managing the disinflation process. Moreover, the Administration has
supported the recovery by taking steps to safeguard financial stability and expand the economy's
productive capacity in a manner that is inclusive and environmentally sound. We believe that
maintaining prudent, forward-looking policies is the most effective way of supporting medium-
to-long-term growth.

As staff note, the U.S. economy has turned in a remarkable performance over the past few
years, and the United States is the only G20 economy that is now operating above the levels
of output and employment that were forecasted prior to the pandemic. The labor market
remains healthy and is gradually easing toward stable and sustainable growth as labor supply and
demand realign. Carefully calibrated Federal Reserve monetary policy has seen inflation ease
significantly since mid-2022, even with persistent economic growth and healthy labor markets.
Business investment has grown rapidly, and we have had three record years of new business
applications. We share staff's concerns about poverty and inequality but stress that we are
witnessing one of the most equitable economic recoveries in U.S. history, with large increases in
Black and Hispanic household wealth and disproportionate wage increases for low-income
workers. Although inflation remains higher than we would like, we expect rents and core
services inflation to further moderate over time, and we believe there is a path for further
disinflation while maintaining a healthy labor market. The U.S. banking sector remains sound
and resilient, and banks have substantial capital to absorb losses and high levels of liquidity to
meet deposit outflows.

Looking to the future, the Biden Administration is prioritizing historic investments aimed
at boosting long-term productivity and addressing inequality. We are starting to reap the
benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and CHIPS Act
through increased investment in clean energy production, infrastructure, and manufacturing
construction. Together, these key pieces of government legislation will increase competitiveness,
transform U.S. efforts to tackle climate change, and help to underpin long-term growth. For
instance, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law invests over $800 million in workforce development,
the CHIPS Act invests over $11 billion in Research and Development, and several of the IRA
provisions include bonus incentives for meeting prevailing wage and apprenticeship criteria. At
the same time, the Administration also remains committed to lowering costs for working families

<!-- PageBreak -->

and is working to bring down prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, utility bills,
and costs for everyday goods and services.


## Monetary Policy

The Federal Reserve remains squarely focused on its dual mandate to promote maximum
employment and stable prices for the American people. Over the past two years, the Federal
Open Market Committee (FOMC) has significantly tightened the stance of monetary policy to
address high inflation. At the FOMC's most recent meeting in June, the Committee voted to
continue to hold the federal funds rate target range at 5.25-5.5 percent and to continue to reduce
the Federal Reserve's securities holdings. The restrictive stance of monetary policy has been
clearly communicated and is putting downward pressure on economic activity and inflation.
High savings by households and corporates may have mitigated some of the effects of high
interest rates, helping sustain strong levels of consumption and investment, as suggested by the
staff assessment. While inflation remains above the 2 percent target, it has eased substantially
and, notably, without a significant increase in unemployment. The Federal Reserve also has
continued to shrink its balance sheet at a brisk pace and in a predictable manner.

The outlook is still uncertain, and the U.S. economy faces both upside and downside risks
to the growth outlook. Reducing rates too soon or by too much could result in a reversal of the
progress we have seen on inflation and ultimately require even tighter policy to get inflation back
to 2 percent. Similarly, easing policy too late or too little could unduly weaken economic activity
and employment. As progress on inflation continues and labor market tightness eases, these risks
continue to move into better balance. The Federal Reserve remains strongly committed to
returning inflation to its 2 percent objective and will remain vigilant to the risks of both higher
inflation and weaker employment. In considering any adjustments to the target range for the
federal funds rate, the FOMC will make decisions meeting by meeting, continuing to carefully
assess the totality of the data, its implications for the outlook, and the balance of risks.


## Fiscal Policy

We believe that the current fiscal stance is appropriate and will yield a stronger, more
sustainable growth path over the medium term. The Administration is rebuilding the U.S.
economy from the middle out and the bottom up by making smart investments in America,
educating and empowering workers, and promoting competition to lower costs and help small
businesses to support strong, stable, and sustainable economic growth. President Biden's
Investing in America agenda is mobilizing historic levels of private sector investments in the
United States, bringing manufacturing back to America after decades of offshoring, and creating
new, well-paying jobs, including union jobs and jobs that do not require a college degree. This
agenda is transforming our country for the better - reaching communities in every corner of the
United States, including those that have too often been left behind.

<!-- PageNumber="2" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

We concur with staff's finding that the United States is "at low overall risk of sovereign
stress and debt is sustainable" and underscore that the Administration is committed to
pursuing a fiscally responsible and sustainable path. The President signed bipartisan
legislation that will reduce the deficit by more than $1 trillion, and he has proposed a budget that
would yield $3 trillion in savings over the next ten years. The President's budget keeps real net
interest-the cost of servicing our debt after inflation-as a share of the economy close to the
average for the last several decades and well below the 2 percent level of the 1990s. We share
staff concerns about the potential negative effects on investor and consumer confidence of
repeated standoffs over the debt limit and possible government shutdowns, and we are
advocating for legislative solutions.

We echo staff's concerns about the rise in poverty in 2022 following the expiration of
critical pandemic era policies and underscore that addressing this is a key policy priority
for the Administration. The President's Budget includes measures, including the enhanced
Child Tax Credit, which could lead to a rapid reduction in poverty like the one witnessed
between 2019 and 2021. Furthermore, the President's enacted legislation, including the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and IRA, are designed to reach the people and places left behind
and could serve to reduce poverty in the long run. We believe that the United States needs a
balanced approach to fiscal policy that asks the wealthy to pay their fair share while continuing
to make investments that support the middle class and grow our economy.


## Financial Stability

Amid easing financial conditions globally, the U.S. financial system has remained stable,
and the banking sector is sound and resilient. Banks continue to report capital and liquidity
ratios above minimum regulatory levels. Overall asset quality remains generally sound. Lending
continues to grow but has slowed from the rapid pace of 2022, reflecting decreased demand and
tighter lending standards. Liquidity conditions overall are stable. Notably, liquid assets on bank
balance sheets remained above their 10-year average throughout 2023, largely the result of a
significant buildup in cash positions. Aggregate deposits were generally stable in the second half
of 2023 and steadily increased in the first quarter of 2024, reaching a level not seen since before
the stress of March of last year. There also has been a decrease in the share of uninsured deposits
in the system. Furthermore, our assessments continue to indicate that most banks appear well-
positioned to absorb commercial real estate (CRE) credit losses under the most likely scenario of
realized losses and gradual recovery over several years.

However, both supervisors and banks must remain vigilant and continue to monitor risks.
It has been a little over a year since the sudden failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and ensuing
stress in the banking system-events which prompted questions about how banks manage risks
and how the Federal Reserve and other agencies supervise that risk-taking. These events
highlighted the need to improve the speed, force, and agility of supervision to align better with
the risks, size, and complexity of supervised banks, as appropriate. The banking agencies are

working to ensure that supervision intensifies at the right pace as a bank grows in size and
complexity, and they are modifying supervisory processes so that issues, once identified, are
addressed more quickly by both banks and supervisors. The Administration supports the banking
agencies' independent work to implement the Basel III standards. We believe that a well-
capitalized banking sector supports financial stability and economic growth, and robust
international standards are important tools to achieve those goals. This includes support for the
work of the regulators to revise their liquidity regulations and supervisory processes. We stress
that many of these changes to supervision and regulation take time to implement.

The Treasury market is the deepest and most liquid market in the world, with about $800
billion in average daily trading volume and a broad and diverse investor base. Despite the
significant yield moves over the last year or two, Treasury market liquidity has been robust and
trading conditions orderly. The Treasury Department and its inter-agency partners are working
on a range of policy initiatives to make sure the Treasury market remains liquid and resilient for
the foreseeable future. The working group's key areas of focus have been data and transparency,
central clearing, and dealer registration. Specifically, in March the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority (FINRA) started dissemination for on-the-run transactions at the end of day and with
size caps, and the Office of Financial Research (OFR) finalized a rule to collect data on non-
centrally cleared bilateral repo. The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) finalized a rule to
expand central clearing, especially for Treasury securities transactions on major trading
platforms and almost all Treasury repos. The SEC also finalized a rule to require firms engaging
in market-making activities to register as dealers. In addition, Treasury has launched a regular
buyback program to support market liquidity.


## Climate Change

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is helping to accelerate the United States' deployment
and production of clean and affordable electricity. The Department of Energy (DOE) recently
released an updated study affirming the transformative climate progress driven by the Inflation
Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. DOE estimates that the two laws will cut
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 41 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. We are
committed to engaging and coordinating with our allies and partners as we work to achieve our
climate and energy security goals and are pursuing a shared approach to making the needed
investments, for example to developing a robust clean energy supply chain that provides reliable,
affordable clean energy. We believe that it is more sustainable to have a diversity of suppliers for
critical energy inputs, and we are engaging with partners to build resilient supply chains in key
sectors like critical minerals.


## Trade and International Context

We find staff's assessment overly critical of U.S. trade policy with no acknowledgement of
the context in which we took these actions. In particular, we disagree with the characterization

of tariffs and domestic content provisions as harmful to U.S. growth and labor markets, as well
as to the global economy. The United States does not deploy broad-based industrial policies
across the entire economy. Instead, U.S. policies are tailored to clear and narrowly scoped
objectives with positive externalities, such as addressing climate change. Furthermore, the
United States did not take these trade actions in a vacuum-but rather took them to respond to
long-standing concerns we and other countries have about China's unfair economic and trade
practices. The United States is promoting supply chain diversification, seeking not to reduce
trade but to increase it with a variety of partners. Our view is that more diversified, resilient trade
will be beneficial to long-term U.S. and global growth.

Finally, we welcome the coverage of governance and anti-corruption in the U.S. Article IV
report and urge other major economies to support inclusion of such coverage in their own
surveillance.
