# Foreword

remember the first week of my career as a VC. I was 25 years
old, it was 1986, and I had just landed a summer job in a venture
capital firm. I was working for three experienced venture capitalists
in a small firm called Euclid Partners, where I ended up spending
the first 10 years of my VC career. One of those three partners,
Bliss McCrum, peeked his head into my office (I had an office in
Rockefeller Center at age 25) and said to me, "Can you model out
a financing for XYZ Company at a $9 million pre-money, raising
$3 million, with an unissued option pool of 10%?" and then went
back to the big office in the rear he shared with the other founding
partner, Milton Pappas.

I sat at my desk and started thinking about the request. I
understood the "raising $3 million" bit. I thought I could figure
out the "unissued option pool of 10%" bit. But what the hell was
"pre-money"? I had never heard that term. This was almost a decade
before Netscape and Internet search so searching online for it wasn't
an option. After spending ten minutes getting up the courage, I
walked back to that big office, peeked my head in, and said to Bliss,
"Can you explain pre-money to me?"

Thus began my 31-year education in venture capital that is still
going on as I write this.

The venture capital business was a cottage industry back in 1985,
with club deals and a language all of its own. A cynic would say it was
designed this way to be opaque to everyone other than the VCs so that
they would have all the leverage in negotiations with entrepreneurs.
I don't entirely buy that narrative. I think the VC business grew up in
a few small offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco, and the
dozens-maybe as many as a hundred-of main participants, along

<!-- PageNumber="xiii" -->

<!-- PageHeader="xiv Foreword" -->

with their lawyers, came up with structures that made sense to them.
They then developed a shorthand so that they could communicate
among themselves.

But whatever the origin story was, the language of venture deals
is foreign to many and remains opaque and confusing to this day.
This works to the advantage of industry insiders and to the disadvan-
tage of those who are new to startups and venture capital.

In the early 2000s, after I wound down my first venture capital
firm, Flatiron Partners, and before we started USV, I started blogging.
One of my goals with my AVC blog (at www.avc.com) was to bring
transparency to this opaque world that I had been inhabiting for
almost 20 years. I was joined in this blogging thing by Brad Feld, a
friend and frequent coinvestor. Club investing has not gone away
and that's a good thing. By reading AVC and Feld Thoughts regu-
larly, an entrepreneur could get up to speed on startups and venture
capital. Brad and I received a tremendous amount of positive feed-
back on our efforts to bring transparency to the venture capital busi-
ness so we kept doing it, and now if you search for something like
"participating preferred" you will find posts written by both me and
Brad on that first search results page.

Brad and his partner Jason Mendelson (a recovering startup law-
yer turned VC) took things a step further and wrote a book called
Venture Deals back in 2011. It has turned into a classic and is now on
its Third Edition. If Venture Deals had been around in 1985, I would
not have had to admit to Bliss that I had no idea what pre-money
meant.

If there is a guidebook to navigating the mysterious and confusing
language of venture capital and venture capital financing structures,
it is Venture Deals. Anyone interested in startups, entrepreneurship,
and angel and venture capital financings should do themselves a
favor and read it.

# Foreword

remember the first time I saw the exit sign for Sand Hill Road
off of Highway 280. It was 1999. I was 22 years old, had just dropped
out of Harvard, and was the cofounder and CTO of a startup based
in Boston. My cofounder and I decided to cast the net wide in our
search for money and flew out to Silicon Valley to meet with VCs.
As I saw the exit for Sand Hill Road, I started to feel incredibly ner-
vous and unwell. I immediately noticed the telltale signs of a distinct
lack of preparation and knowledge. I felt this way if I hadn't stud-
ied thoroughly for a test in school. In high school, right before a
cross-country race, I felt this way if I hadn't put in enough miles of
running in practice. By this time, hadn't I learned my lesson about
preparation and its effect on my digestive system? Why did I show up
to such important meetings so uninformed about the people and
the industry from whom I was trying to raise money from? Well, in
1999, it wasn't so easy for a 22-year-old first-time entrepreneur to
figure all of this out.

We did succeed in raising money for that startup, but due to
our own mistakes and the tough environment at the time, we ended
up closing our doors a couple of years later. However, I made a
couple of great friends, Eric and Gokhan, from that startup, and
we picked ourselves up and immediately started another company
called Windup Labs. After four years of incredibly hard work, we
sold Windup to CNET Networks (now part of CBS Interactive) in
2005, and as part of the acquisition, we all moved to San Francisco.

In 2007, Eric and I left CNET to start Fitbit. Eric and I started
off with fairly modest ambitions for the company, but as the years
passed, our ambitions grew. From 2007 to today, the company
grew to over 1,500 employees, and our most recent guidance to

<!-- PageNumber="XV" -->

<!-- PageHeader="xvi Foreword" -->

investors called for approximately $2.5 billion in revenue in 2016. We
raised over $66 million in private capital from VCs, including Brad
and Jason at Foundry Group. In 2015, Fitbit went public, raising over
$800 million in the largest-ever consumer electronics initial public
offering (IPO) in history. I've remained its CEO from founding to
today.

As I read this book, I was amazed at how succinctly it captured
the sum of my 16 years of experience raising money, dealing, and
working with VCs and corporate lawyers. I wish I could travel back
in time and hand this book off to my nervous and ill 22-year-old self
(along with an iPhone and the idea for Facebook).

You, the reader, have gotten a huge bargain. After finishing this
book, you will have skipped years of painful experience, trial and
error, and learning on the clock from expensive lawyers. This is the
business book equivalent of Neo jacking in and learning kung fu in
an instant in The Matrix. As you find yourself driving down 280 (or,
depending on how long this foreword lasts, being whisked in your
autonomous electric car) and the sign for Sand Hill Road comes
into view, feel confident that you've been prepared by some of the
best VCs I know.

ne of the ways to finance a company is to raise venture capital.
While only a small percentage of companies raise venture capital,
many of the great technology companies that have been created,
including Google, Apple, Cisco Systems, Yahoo!, Netscape, Sun
Microsystems, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, and
America Online (AOL) raised venture capital early in their lives.
Some of today's fastest-growing entrepreneurial companies, such
as Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, LinkedIn, Fitbit, and Uber were also
recipients of venture capital.

Over the past 20 years we've been involved in hundreds of
venture capital financings. A decade ago, after a particularly
challenging financing, we decided to write a series of blog posts that
would demystify the venture capital financing process. The result
was the Term Sheet Series on Brad's blog (www.feld.com/archives/
category/term-sheet), which was the inspiration for this book.

As each new generation of entrepreneurs emerges, there is a
renewed interest in how venture capital deals come together. We
encounter many of these first-time entrepreneurs through our activities
as venture capitalists at our firm Foundry Group (www.foundrygroup
.com), as well as our involvement in Techstars (www.techstars.com).
We have been regularly reminded that there is no definitive guide to
venture capital deals and as a result set out to create one.

In addition to describing venture capital deals in depth, we've
tried to create context around the players, the deal dynamics,
and how venture capital funds work. We've tossed in a section on
negotiation, if only to provide another viewpoint into the brains of
how a venture capitalist (at least the two of us) might think about
negotiation. We also took on explaining the other term sheet that

<!-- PageNumber="xvii" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="xviii Preface" -->

fortunate entrepreneurs will encounter-namely, the letter of intent
to acquire your company.

We've tried to take a balanced view between the entrepreneurs'
perspective and the venture capitalists' perspective. As early-stage
investors, we know we are biased toward an early-stage perspective,
but we try to provide context that will apply to any financing stage.
We've also tried to make fun of lawyers any chance we get.

We hope you find this book useful in your quest to create a great
company.


### Audience

When we first conceived this book, we planned to target it at first-
time entrepreneurs. We both have a long history of funding and
working with first-time entrepreneurs and often learn more from
them than they learn from us. Through our involvement in Tech-
stars, we've heard a wide range of questions about financings and
venture capital from first-time entrepreneurs. We've tried to do a
comprehensive job of addressing those questions in this book.

As we wrote the book, we realized it was also useful for expe-
rienced entrepreneurs. A number of the entrepreneurs who read
early drafts or heard about what we were writing gave us feedback
that they wished a book like this had existed when they were start-
ing their first company. When we asked the question, "Would this be
useful for you today?" many said, "Yes, absolutely." Several sections,
including the ones on negotiation and how venture capital funds
work, were inspired by long dinner conversations with experienced
entrepreneurs who told us that we had to write this stuff down, either
on our blog or in a book. Well-here it is!

Of course, before one becomes a first-time entrepreneur, one
is often an aspiring entrepreneur. This book is equally relevant
for the aspiring entrepreneur of whatever age. In addition, any-
one in school who is interested in entrepreneurship-whether
in business school, law school, an undergraduate program, or
an advanced degree program-should benefit from this book.
We've both taught many classes on various topics covered in this
book and hope this becomes standard reading for any class on
entrepreneurship.

We were once inexperienced venture capitalists. We learned
mostly by paying attention to more experienced venture capitalists, as

well as actively engaging in deals. We hope this book becomes another
tool in the tool chest for any young or aspiring venture capitalist.

While we've aimed the book at entrepreneurs, we hope that even
lawyers (especially those who don't have much experience doing ven-
ture capital deals) and experienced venture capitalists will benefit from
us putting these thoughts down in one place. At the minimum, we
hope they recommend the book to their less experienced colleagues.

Finally, unintended beneficiaries of this book are the spouses
of venture capitalists, lawyers, and entrepreneurs, especially those
entrepreneurs actively involved in a deal. While Brad's wife, Amy, is
quick to say, "Everything I've learned about venture came from over-
hearing your phone calls," we hope other spouses can dip into this
book every now and then. This can be especially useful when your
entrepreneurial life partner some empathy while complaining about
how a venture capitalist is trying to sneak a participating preferred
into a round.


### Overview of the Contents

We start off with a brief history of the venture capital term sheet
and a discussion of the different parties who participate in venture
capital transactions.

We then discuss how to raise money from a venture capitalist,
including determining how much money an entrepreneur should raise
and what types of materials one will need before hitting the fundrais-
ing trail. Included in this section is a discussion about the process that
many venture capitalists follow to decide which companies to fund.

We then dive deeply into the particular terms that are included
in venture capital term sheets. We've separated this into three
chapters-terms related to economics, terms related to control,
and all of the other terms. We strive to give a balanced view of the
particular terms along with strategies to getting to a fair deal.

Following the chapters on terms, we discuss how convertible
debt works and the pros and cons versus raising equity.

We've introduced a new section in this edition about crowdfund-
ing, how it differs from traditional venture capital deals, and how we
think the crowdfunding ecosystem will affect venture capital.

We then go into a frank discussion about how venture capital
firms operate, including how venture capitalists are motivated and
compensated. We then discuss how these structural realities can

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="xx Preface" -->

impact a company's chance of getting funded or the relationship
between the venture capitalist, her firm, and the entrepreneur after
the investment is made.

Since the process of funding involves a lot of negotiation, the
book contains a primer on negotiations and how particular strat-
egies may work better or worse in the venture capital world. We
also attempt to help the entrepreneur learn ways to consummate a
transaction in a venture capital financing while avoiding common
mistakes and pitfalls.

Since there is no such thing as a standard venture capital
financing, we cover different issues to consider that depend on the
stage of financing a company is raising. We also discuss some of the
theories behind why any of these documents even exist so that you
can understand the hidden incentives in the process.

As a bonus, we've tossed in a chapter about the other impor-
tant term sheet that entrepreneurs need to know about: the letter of
intent to acquire your company.

Finally, we end with why term sheets even exist in the first place
along with tips concerning several common legal issues that most
startups face. While not a dissertation on everything an entrepre-
neur needs to know, we've tried to include a few important things
that we think entrepreneurs should pay attention to.

Throughout the book we've enlisted a close friend and longtime
entrepreneur, Matt Blumberg, the CEO of Return Path, to add his
perspective. Whenever you see a sidebar titled "The Entrepreneur's
Perspective," these are comments from Matt on the previous section.


### Additional Materials

Along with this book, we've created some additional materials that
you may want to review. They are all on the Venture Deals website at
www.venturedeals.com, which was referred to in previous editions as
the AsktheVC website at www.askthevc.com. And no, the price of the
Venture Deals domain wasn't very high.

Venture Deals (previously AsktheVC) started out several years ago
as a question-and-answer site that we managed. We've recently added
a new section called "Resources," where the reader can find many
standard forms of documents that are used in venture financings.
They include the term sheet as well as all of the documents that are
generated from the term sheet as part of a venture financing.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Preface" -->

We have included the standard forms that we use at Foundry
Group (you can use these if we ever finance your company). We've
also included links for the most popular standard documents that
are used in the industry today, along with commentary about some
of the advantages and disadvantages of using them.

Additional resources for classroom use are available to professors.

# Acknowledgments

W.
e wouldn't have been able to write this book without the able
assistance of many people.

A huge thanks goes to Matt Blumberg, CEO of Return Path,
for all of his insightful and entrepreneur-focused comments. Matt
provided all of the sidebars for "The Entrepreneur's Perspective"
throughout the book, and his comments helped focus us (and hope-
fully you) on the key issues from an entrepreneur's perspective.

Our Foundry Group partners, Seth Levine, Ryan McIntyre, and
Lindel Eakman, put up with us whenever Brad said, "I'm working
on Jason's book again," and whenever Jason said, "I'm working on
Brad's book again." We couldn't do any of this without our amazing
colleagues at Foundry Group, including our assistants, Jill Spruiell
and Mary Weingartner.

A number of friends, colleagues, and mentors reviewed early
drafts of the book and gave us extensive feedback. Thanks to the
following for taking the time to meaningfully improve this book:
Amy Batchelor, Raj Bhargava, Jeff Clavier, Greg Gottesman, Brian
Grayson, Douglas Horch, David Jilk, TA McCann, George Mulhern,
Wiley Nelson, Heidi Roizen, Ken Tucker, and Jud Valeski.

Jack Tankersley, one of the fathers of the Colorado venture
capital industry, provided a number of his early deal books from his
time at Centennial Funds. In addition to being fascinating history
on some legendary early venture capital deals, they confirmed that
the term sheet hasn't evolved much over the past 30 years. We'd also
like to thank Jack for the extensive comments he made on an early
draft of the book.

Thanks to Bill Aulet and Patricia Fuligni of the MIT Entrepreneur-
ship Center for helping track down the original Digital Equipment
Corporation correspondence between Ken Olson and Georges Doriot.

Our VC brethren, whether they realize it or not, have had a huge
impact on this book. The ones we've learned from-both good and
bad-are too numerous to list. But we want to thank them all for par-
ticipating with us on our journey to help create amazing companies.

We can't think of anything we'd rather be doing professionally, and
we learn something new from you every day.

We've worked with many lawyers over the years, some of whom
have taken us to school on various topics in this book. We thank
you for all of your help, advice, education, and entertainment. We'd
especially like to thank our friends Eric Jensen and Mike Platt at
Cooley LLP, who have consistently helped us during the fog of a
negotiation. Eric was Jason's mentor, boss, and friend while at Cooley
and originally taught Jason how all of this worked.

We'd like to thank one of Brad's original mentors, Len Fassler,
for creating the spark that initiated this book. Len's introduction
to Matthew Kissner, the chairman at John Wiley & Sons, resulted
in a two-book contract with Wiley, which included Do More Faster:
TechStars Lessons to Accelerate Your Startup by Brad and David Cohen.
Although Do More Faster was published first, the idea for this book
was the one that originally captured the attention of several people
at Wiley.

Brad would like to thank Pink Floyd for The Dark Side of the Moon
and Wish You Were Here, two albums that kept him going through-
out the seemingly endless "read through and edit this just one more
time" cycle. He'd also like to thank the great staff at Canyon Ranch in
Tucson for giving him a quiet place to work for the last week before
the "final final draft of the first edition" was due.

Jason would like to thank the University of Colorado Law School
and especially Brad Bernthal and Phil Weiser for letting him subject
himself to both law and business students while teaching many of the
subjects contained in this book. Special thanks to Herbie Hancock
for providing the background music while Jason worked on this book.

A number of friends and colleagues found errors in the first
and second editions, which we dutifully listed at www.askthevc.com/
wp/errata. Special thanks go to David Cohen, Anurag Mehta, Tom
Godin, Philip Lee, Tal Adler, Jason Seats, and Jeff Thomas who were
the first to identify each error.

We thank all of the entrepreneurs we have ever had the chance
to work with. Without you, we have nothing to do. Hopefully we have
made you proud in our attempt to amalgamate in this book all of the
collective wisdom we gained from working with you.

Finally, we thank our wives, Amy Batchelor and Jennifer Men-
delson, for putting up with us and making our lives so much more
fulfilling.

# Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet

0
ne of the first famous venture capital investments was Digital
Equipment Corporation (DEC). In 1957, American Research and
Development Corporation (AR&D), one of the first venture capital
firms, invested $70,000 in DEC. When DEC went public in 1968, this
investment was worth over $355 million, or a return of over 5,000
times the invested capital. AR&D's investment in DEC was one of the
original venture capital home runs.

In 1957, the venture capital industry was just being created. At the
time, the investor community in the United States was uninterested
in investing in computer companies, as the last wave of computer-
related startups had performed poorly and even large companies
were having difficulty making money in the computer business. We
can envision the frustration of DEC's cofounders, Ken Olson and
Harlan Anderson, as the investors they talked to rejected them
and their fledgling idea for a business. We can also imagine their
joy when Georges Doriot, the founder of American Research and
Development Corporation, offered to fund them. After a number
of conversations and meetings, Doriot sent Olson and Anderson a
letter expressing his interest in investing, along with his proposed
terms. Today, this document is called the term sheet.

Now, imagine what that term sheet looked like. There are three
different possibilities. The first is that it was a typed one-page let-
ter that said, "We would like to invest $70,000 in your company
and buy 78 percent of it." The next is that it was two pages of legal
terms that basically said, "We would like to invest $70,000 in your
company and buy 78 percent of it." Or it could have been an eight-
page typed document that had all kinds of protective provisions, vesting

<!-- PageNumber="1" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="2" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

arrangements, drag-along rights, and Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) registration rights.

Our guess is that it was not the third option. Over the past 50
years, the art of the term sheet has evolved and expanded, reaching
its current eight (or so) page literary masterpiece. These eight pages
contain a lot more than "We'd like to invest $X in your company
and get Y% of it," but, as you'll learn, there really are only two key
things that matter in the actual term sheet negotiation-economics
and control.

In DEC's case, by owning 78% of the company, AR&D effec-
tively had control of the company. And the price was clearly
defined-$70,000 bought 78% of the company, resulting in a $90,000
post-money valuation.

Today's venture capital investments have many more nuances.
Individual venture capitalists (VCs) usually end up owning less than
50 percent of the company, so they don't have effective voting con-
trol but often negotiate provisions that give them control over major
decisions by the company. Many companies end up with multiple
venture capitalists who invest in the company at different points in
time, resulting in different ownership percentages, varying rights,
and diverging motivations. Founders don't always stay with the com-
pany through the exit and, in some cases, they end up leaving rela-
tively early in the life of a company for a variety of reasons. Compa-
nies fail, so venture capitalists have gotten much more focused on
protecting themselves for the downside as well as participating in the
upside. Governance issues are always complex, especially when you
have a lot of people sitting around the negotiating table.

While it would be desirable to do venture capital deals with a
simple agreement on price, a handshake, and a short legal agree-
ment, this rarely happens. And while there have been plenty of
attempts to standardize the term sheet over the years, the prolifera-
tion of lawyers, venture capitalists, and entrepreneurs, along with a
steadily increasing number of investments, has prevented this from
happening. Ironically, the actual definitive documents have become
more standard over time. Whether it is the Internet age that has
spread information across the ecosystem or clients growing tired of
paying legal bills, there are more similarities in the documents today
than ever before. As a result, we can lend you our experience in how
venture financings are usually done. The good news is once you've

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="3" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Introduction: The Art of the Term Sheet" -->

negotiated the term sheet, you are done with the hard part. As a
result, that's where we are going to focus our energy in this book.

Throughout this book we will cover not only the what and the
how, but also the why things work as they do. Let's begin our explora-
tion of venture capital financings by discussing the various players
involved.

## CHAPTER


## The Players

W
hile it might seem like there are only two players in the financ-
ing dance-the entrepreneur and the venture capitalist-there are
often others, including angel investors, lawyers, and mentors. Any
entrepreneur who has created a company that has gone through
multiple financings knows that the number of people involved can
quickly spiral out of control, especially if you aren't sure who actually
is making the decisions at each step along the way.

The experience, motivation, and relative power of each partici-
pant in a financing can be complex, and the implications are often
mysterious. Let's begin our journey to understanding venture capi-
tal financings by making sure we understand each player and the
dynamics surrounding the participants.


### The Entrepreneur

Not all investors (and bankers and lawyers, for that matter) realize it,
but the entrepreneur is the center of the entrepreneurial universe.
Without entrepreneurs there would be no term sheet and no startup
ecosystem.

Throughout this book we use the words entrepreneur and founder
interchangeably. While some companies have only one founder,
many have two, three, or even more. Sometimes these cofounders
are equals; other times they aren't. Regardless of the number, they
each have a key role in the formation of the company and any financ-
ing that occurs.

<!-- PageNumber="5" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="6" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

The founders can't and shouldn't outsource their involvement
in a financing to their lawyers. There are many issues in a financing
negotiation that only the entrepreneurs can resolve. Even if you hire
a fantastic lawyer who knows everything, don't forget that if your
lawyer and your future investors don't get along, you will have larger
issues to deal with, as the way your lawyer represents himself will
directly reflect on you. If you are the entrepreneur, make sure you
direct and control the process.

The relationship between the founders at the beginning of the
life of a company is almost always good. If it's not, the term sheet and
corresponding financing are probably the least of the founders' wor-
ries. However, as time passes, the relationship between cofounders
often frays. This could be due to many different factors: the stress of
the business, competence, personality, or even changing life priori-
ties like a new spouse or children.

When this happens, one or more founders often leave the
business-sometimes on good terms and sometimes on not such
good terms. Some investors know that it's best to anticipate these
kinds of issues up front and will try to structure terms that pre-
define how things will work in these situations. The investors are
often trying to protect the founders from each other by making
sure things can be cleanly resolved without disrupting the com-
pany more than the departure of a founder already does.

We cover this dynamic in terms like vesting, drag-along rights,
and co-sale rights. When we do, we discuss both the investor perspec-
tive and the entrepreneur perspective. You'll see this throughout
the book-we've walked in both the investor's and the entrepre-
neur's shoes, and we try hard to take a balanced approach to our
commentary.


### The Venture Capitalist

The venture capitalist (VC) is the next character in the term sheet
play. VCs come in many shapes, sizes, and experience levels. While
most (but not all) profess to be entrepreneur friendly, many fall far
short of their aspirations. The first sign of this often appears during
the term sheet negotiation.

Venture capital firms have their own hierarchies that are impor-
tant for an entrepreneur to understand. Later in the book we'll dive
into all the deep, dark secrets about how VCs are motivated and

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="7" -->
<!-- PageHeader="The Players" -->

paid, and what their incentives can be. For now, we'll consider VCs
as humans and talk about the people.

The most senior person in the firm is usually called a managing
director (MD) or a general partner (GP). In some cases, these titles have
an additional prefix-such as executive managing director or founding
general partner-to signify even more seniority over the other manag-
ing directors or general partners. These VCs make the final invest-
ment decisions and sit on the boards of directors of the companies
they invest in.

Partners are usually not what their title says they are. Many VCs
these days carry business cards with a "Partner" title but are not actu-
ally partners in the firm. Instead, they are often junior deal profes-
sionals (also referred to as principals or directors-see the next para-
graph) or are involved in specific aspects of the investing process
such as deal sourcing. In some firms, which are described as full-stack
VC firms, these partners help companies across a variety of dimen-
sions, including recruiting, operations, technology, sales, and mar-
keting, but are not decision makers in the investment process.

Principals, or directors, are usually next in line. These are junior
deal professionals working their way up the ladder to managing
director. Principals usually have some deal responsibility, but they
almost always require support from a managing director to move a
deal through the VC firm. So while a principal has some power, he
probably can't make a final decision.

Associates are typically not deal partners. Instead, they work
directly for one or more deal partners, usually a managing director.
Associates do a wide variety of things, including scouting for new
deals, helping with due diligence on existing deals, and writing up
endless internal memos about prospective investments. They are
also likely to be the person in the firm who spends the most time
with the capitalization table (also known as a cap table), which is
the spreadsheet that defines the economics of the deal. Many firms
have an associate program, often lasting two years, after which time
the associate leaves the firm to go work for a portfolio company, go
to business school, or start up a company. Occasionally, the star asso-
ciates go on to become principals.

Analysts are at the bottom of the ladder. These are very junior
people, usually recently graduated from college, who sit in a room
with no windows down the hall from everyone else, crunch numbers,
and write memos. In some firms, analysts and associates play similar

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="8" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

roles and have similar functions; in others, the associates are more
deal-centric. Regardless, analysts are generally smart people who are
usually very limited in power and responsibility.

Some firms, especially larger ones, have a variety of venture part-
ners or operating partners. These are experienced entrepreneurs who
have a part-time relationship with the VC firms. While they have
the ability to sponsor a deal, they often need explicit support of
one of the MDs, just as a principal would, in order to get a deal
done. In some firms, operating partners don't sponsor deals, but
take an active role in managing the investment as a chairman or
board member.

Entrepreneurs in residence (EIRs) are another type of part-time
member of the VC firm. EIRs are experienced entrepreneurs who
park themselves at a VC firm while they are working on figuring out
their next company. They often help the VC with introductions, due
diligence, and networking during the 3- to 12-month period that
they are an EIR. Some VCs pay their EIRs; others simply provide
them with free office space and an implicit agreement to invest in
their next company.

In small firms, you might be dealing only with MDs. For exam-
ple, in our firm, Foundry Group, we have a total of five partners, all
called managing directors, each of whom has the same responsibil-
ity, authority, and power. In large firms, you'll be dealing with a wide
array of MDs, principals, associates, analysts, venture partners, oper-
ating partners, EIRs, and other titles. Since we wrote the first edition
of this book in 2011, there has been a huge amount of title inflation
among VC firms as what was referred to as an associate in 2011 might
now be referred to as a partner.

Entrepreneurs should do their research on the firms they are
talking to in order to understand who they are talking to, what
decision-making power that person has, and what processes they
have to go through to get an investment approved. The best
sources for this kind of information are other entrepreneurs who
have worked with the VC firm in the past, although you'd also be
surprised how much of this you can piece together just by look-
ing at how a VC firm presents itself on its website. If all else fails,
you can always ask the VC how things work, although the further
down the hierarchy of the firm they are, the less likely you'll get
completely accurate information.

## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Managing directors or general partners have the mojo inside venture capital
firms. If you have anyone else prospecting you or working on the deal with you
(associate, senior associate, principal, venture partner, or EIR), treat her with an
enormous amount of respect, but insist on developing a direct relationship with
an MD or a GP as well. Anyone other than an MD or a GP is unlikely to be at the
firm for the long haul. The MDs and GPs are the ones who matter and who will
make decisions about your company.


### Financing Round Nomenclature

Aside from the humans who work at a venture firm, there are also
different types of venture firms. Understanding the different types of
firms will help you target the right ones as you are raising a financing.

Most firms define themselves by the stage of financing they invest
in. You've probably heard of different letters associated with financ-
ing rounds: Series A, Series B, Series B Prime, Series G, Series Seed,
and even Series Pre-Seed. You'll hear about Series B-2 rounds and
Series D-3 rounds. As funding cycles change, you'll hear about "The
Series A Crunch" or "The Series B Crunch," or even the notion that
"The Series A is the new Series B."

There is no magic or legal definition in naming rounds. We'd
prefer to name them after different hiking trails in Boulder, but we'd
confuse too many people, so we stick to letters. It used to be that
the Series A round was the first financing, the Series B was the next
round, and the Series C was the next round. After the Series C often
came the Series D. You get the picture.

At some point, investors who were making very early-stage invest-
ments, also referred to as seed rounds, decided that there needed be
a letter before "A" and started to call those deals Series Seed. While we
have always felt it was perfectly reasonable to call these seed rounds
a Series A, this emerged around the time that there was a new wave
of VC firms making seed investments, while at the same time many of
the firms who previously considered themselves early-stage investors
were letting these new firms make the first investment. The other
firms still liked to refer to themselves as early-stage investors, so the
old Series A became the Series Seed and the old Series B started to
be called Series A. Today, you'll occasionally hear of a Pre-Seed Round,

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="10" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

which is simply an effort to label an earlier round that occurs before
the seed round.

At the same time, companies didn't want to have letters that
extended far into the alphabet. When you are doing your Series K
round, the first thing a VC wonders is "what is wrong with you?"
Since an increasing number of rounds were inheriting the same
terms, either at the same or different price as the earlier round, one
started getting numerical round extensions. When the same inves-
tors who invested $10 million in a Series B added on another $5
million to the company on the same terms, this became the Series
B-1. If another $5 million was invested in the company at the same
terms, this became the Series B-2. When a new investor led the next
$22 million financing, this finally became the Series C, instead of the
Series E, which is what it would have been if the B-1 were the C and
the B-2 were the D.

While the labeling of rounds can be complicated, what is impor-
tant is that there is a language to discuss how early or late stage a
company is when determining what VC might be right for you. Gen-
erally, Pre-Seed, Seed, and Series A are early-stage companies, Series
B and Care mid-stage companies, and Series D or later is a late-stage
company.


### Types of Venture Capital Firms

Now that we've got the nomenclature of rounds down, we can talk
about which types of firms invest in which rounds.

A micro VC fund is a small venture firm that often has only one
general partner. Many of these folks started out as angel investors,
which we will talk about in the next section, and, after some success,
created a fund to invest other people's money alongside their own.
Sizes of these funds can vary, but are usually less than $15 million in
total capital per fund. These firms almost exclusively invest at the
seed and early stages, often alongside other micro VC firms, angel
investors, and friend and family investors.

Seed-stage funds are generally bigger than micro VCs and can
scale up to $150 million per fund. They focus on being the first
institutional money into a company and rarely invest in later rounds
past a Series A. Seed-stage funds often provide your first noncom-
pany board member, so be thoughtful as this relationship goes well
beyond just the investment.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="11" -->
<!-- PageHeader="The Players" -->

Next up are the early-stage funds. These are the funds that are
generally $100 million to $300 million in size and invest in seed
stage and Series A companies but occasionally lead a Series B round.
These firms also often continue to invest later in the life of a com-
pany, often taking their pro rata in subsequent rounds, which we'll
explain later in this book.

Mid-stage funds are those that generally invest in Series B and
later rounds. The funds are often called growth investors, as their first
investment in a company is at a point where a company is clearly
working, but now needs capital to accelerate, or continue, its growth.
These funds usually range from $200 million to $1 billion in size.

Late-stage funds enter the picture when the company is now a suc-
cessful stand-alone business, typically doing its last financing before
a prospective initial public offering (IPO). These include specific
late-stage VC funds, but also can be hedge funds, crossover inves-
tors that invest primarily in the public markets, funds associated with
large banks, or sovereign wealth funds.

Like all things in the VC world, you can't categorize each firm
tightly. Some firms with billion-dollar funds have early-stage programs
that invest in young companies. Some firms have multiple funds that
invest in different stages of a company, like we do at Foundry Group.
We have early-stage funds that invest in the early stages (seed, A, and
B) and later-stage funds (which we call Foundry Group Select and
Foundry Group Next) that invest in growth rounds, similar to what
a mid-stage firm would do. Some firms have dedicated programs or
partners per stage and others invest along the company life cycle
with no special delineations.

Ultimately, the key is to make sure that you are targeting the
types of firms that invest in your stage of company. One of the most
common mistakes entrepreneurs make is focusing on firms that are
irrelevant for them at the stage they are at.


### The Angel Investor

In addition to VCs, your investor group may include individual inves-
tors, usually referred to as angel investors (or angels for short). These
angels are often a key source of early-stage investment and are very
active in the first round of investment, or the seed stage. Angels can
be professional investors, successful entrepreneurs, friends, or fam-
ily members.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="12" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Many VCs are very comfortable investing alongside angels and
often encourage their active involvement early in the life of a com-
pany. As a result, the angels are an important part of any financ-
ing dance. However, not all angels are created equal, nor do all VCs
share the same view of angels.

While angels will invest at various points in time, they usually
invest in the early rounds and often don't participate in future
rounds. In cases where everything is going well, this is rarely an issue.
However, if the company hits some speed bumps and has a difficult
financing, the angels' participation in future rounds may come into
question. Some of the terms we discuss in the book, such as pay-to-
play and drag-along rights, are specifically designed to help the VCs
force a certain type of behavior on the angels (and other VC inves-
tors) in these difficult financing rounds.

While angel investors are usually high-net-worth individuals, they
aren't always. There are specific Securities and Exchange Commis-
sion (SEC) rules around accredited investors, and you should make
sure that each of your angel investors qualifies as an accredited inves-
tor or has an appropriate exemption. This has become more compli-
cated with the passage of the JOBS Act in 2012, and we'll discuss this
further in Chapter 9, "Crowdfunding." The best way to ensure you
are following the rules correctly is to ask your lawyer for help.

Some angel investors make a lot of small investments. These very
active, or promiscuous, angels are called super angels. These super
angels are often experienced entrepreneurs who have had one or
more exits and have decided to invest their own money in new start-
ups. In most cases, super angels are well known in entrepreneurial
circles and are often a huge help to early-stage companies.

As super angels make more investments, they often decide to
raise capital from their friends, other entrepreneurs, or institutions.
At this point the super angel raises a fund similar to a VC fund and
becomes a micro VC. While these micro VCs often want to be thought
of as angels instead of VCs, once they've raised money from other
people, they have the same fiduciary responsibility to their investors
that a VC has, and as a result they are really just VCs.

It's important to remember that there isn't a generic angel inves-
tor archetype (nor is there a generic VC archetype). Lumping them
together and referring to them as a single group can be dangerous.
Never assume any of these people are like one another. They will all
have their own incentives, pressures, experiences, and sophistication

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageHeader="The Players" -->

levels. Their individual characteristics will often define your working
relationship with them well beyond any terms that you negotiate.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Don't put yourself in a position where you can be held hostage by angels. They
are important, but they are rarely in a position to determine the company's direc-
tion. If your angel group is a small, diffuse list of friends and family, consider
setting up a special-purpose limited partnership controlled by one of them as a
vehicle for them to invest. Chasing down 75 signatures when you want to do a
financing or sell the company is not fun.

Also, true friends and family need special care. Make sure they under-
stand up front that (1) they should think of their investment as a lottery ticket,
and (2) every holiday or birthday party is not an investor relations meeting.


### The Syndicate

While some VCs invest alone, many invest with other VCs. A collec-
tion of investors is called a syndicate.

When VCs refer to the syndicate, they are often talking about
the major participants in the financing round, which are usually but
not always VCs. The syndicate includes any investor, whether a VC,
angel, super angel, strategic investor, corporation, law firm, or any-
one else that ends up purchasing equity in a financing.

Most syndicates have a lead investor. Usually, but not always, this is
one of the VC investors. Two VCs will often co-lead a syndicate, and
occasionally you'll see three co-leads.

While there is nothing magical about who the lead investor is,
having one often makes it easier for the entrepreneurs to focus their
energy around the negotiation. Rather than having one-off negotia-
tions with each investor, the lead in the syndicate will often take the
role of negotiating terms for the entire syndicate.

Regardless of the lead investor or the structure of the syndicate,
it is the entrepreneurs' responsibility to make sure they are com-
municating with each of the investors in the syndicate. As the entre-
preneur, even though the lead investor may help corral the other
investors through the process, don't assume that you don't need to
communicate with each of the investors-you do!

Be careful of too many cooks in the kitchen. In the past few years,
the idea of a party round, where many investors make relatively small

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="14" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

investments at the early stage, has become popular. It isn't unusual
to see a $2 million seed round with 10 VCs and 20 angel investors in
the round. While it might seem nice to have all these fancy names in
a press release, the entrepreneurs get very little attention from any
of the investors since their investments were all tiny relative to what
the VCs normally invest. As companies raise their next round, they
realize they have the worst of all possible worlds-lots of VCs who are
investors, but none who are committed in a meaningful way.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

While you should communicate with all investors, you should insist that inves-
tors agree (at least verbally) that the lead investor can speak for the whole
syndicate when it comes to investment terms. You should not let yourself be in
a position where you have to negotiate the same deal multiple times. If there is
dissension in the ranks, ask the lead investor for help.


### The Lawyer

Ah, the lawyers-I bet you thought we'd never get to them. In deals,
a great lawyer can be a huge help and a bad lawyer can be a disaster.

For the entrepreneur, an experienced lawyer who understands
VC financings is invaluable. VCs make investments all the time.
Entrepreneurs raise money occasionally. Even a very experienced
entrepreneur runs the risk of getting hung up on a nuance that a VC
has thought through many times.

In addition to helping negotiate, a great lawyer can focus the
entrepreneur on what really matters. While this book will cover all
the terms that typically come up in a VC financing, we'll continue to
repeat a simple mantra that the real terms that matter are economics
and control. Yes, annoying VCs will inevitably spend time negotiat-
ing for an additional S-3 registration right (an unimportant term
that we'll discuss later), even though the chance it ever comes into
play is very slight. This is just life in a negotiation-there are always
endless tussles over unimportant points, sometimes due to silly rea-
sons, but they are often used as a negotiating strategy to distract you
from the main show. VCs are experts at this; a great lawyer can keep
you from falling into these traps.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="15" -->
<!-- PageHeader="The Players" -->

However, a bad lawyer, or one inexperienced in VC financings,
can do you a world of harm. In addition to getting outnegotiated,
the inexperienced lawyer will focus on the wrong issues, fight hard
on things that don't matter, and run up the bill on both sides. We've
encountered this numerous times. Whenever an entrepreneur wants
to use a cousin who is a divorce lawyer, we take an aggressive posi-
tion before we start negotiating that the entrepreneur needs a lawyer
who has a clue.

Never forget that your lawyer is a reflection on you. Your repu-
tation in the startup ecosystem is important, and a bad or inexpe-
rienced lawyer will tarnish it. Furthermore, once the deal is done,
you'll be partners with your investors, so you don't want a bad or inex-
perienced lawyer creating unnecessary tension in the financing nego-
tiation that will carry over once you are partners with your investors.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

At the same time that you don't want an inexperienced lawyer creating unnec-
essary tension in the negotiation, don't let a VC talk you out of using your lawyer
of choice just because that lawyer isn't from a nationally known firm or the
lawyer rubs the VC the wrong way. This is your lawyer, not your VC's lawyer.
That said, to do this well, you need to be close enough to the communication
to make sure your lawyer is being reasonable and communicating clearly and
in a friendly manner.

While lawyers usually bill by the hour, many lawyers experienced
with VC investments will cap their fees in advance of the deal. As of
this writing in 2016, an early-stage financing can be done for between
$5,000 and $20,000 and a typical mid- to late-stage financing can be
completed for between $20,000 and $40,000. Lawyers in large cities
tend to charge more, and if your company has any items to clean up
from your past, your costs will increase.

If your lawyers and the VC lawyers don't get along, your bill can
skyrocket if you don't stay involved in the process. If the lawyers are
unwilling to agree to a modest fee cap, you should question whether
they know what they are doing.

In case you are curious, these numbers are virtually unchanged
from a decade ago while billable rates have more than doubled in
the same time. What this means is that document standardization is

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="16" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

a reality, but it also means that the average lawyer spends less time
per deal than in ancient times (the 1990s). Once again, the entre-
preneur must take responsibility for the final results.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Don't be shy about insisting that your lawyer cap their fee at a modest number
or even that the lawyer will only get paid out of the proceeds of a deal. There's
no reason, if you are a solid entrepreneur with a good business, that even a top-
tier law firm won't take your unpaid deal to its executive committee as a flier to
be paid on closing.


### The Mentor

Every entrepreneur should have a stable of experienced mentors.
These mentors can be hugely useful in any financing, especially if
they know the VCs involved.

We like to refer to these folks as mentors instead of advisers
since the word adviser often implies that there is some sort of fee
agreement with the company. It's unusual for a company, espe-
cially an early-stage one, to have a fee arrangement with an adviser
around a financing. Nonetheless, there are advisers who prey on
entrepreneurs by showing up, offering to help raise money, and
then asking for compensation by taking a cut of the deal. There
are even some bold advisers who ask for a retainer relationship to
help out. We encourage early-stage entrepreneurs to stay away from
these advisers.

In contrast, mentors help the entrepreneurs, especially early-
stage ones, primarily because someone once helped them. Many
mentors end up being early angel investors in companies or get a
small equity grant for serving on the board of directors or board of
advisers, but they rarely ask for anything up front.

While having mentors is never required, we strongly encourage
entrepreneurs to find them, work with them, and build long-term
relationships with them. The benefits are enormous and often sur-
prising. Most great mentors we know do it because they enjoy it.
When this is the motivation, you often see some great relationships
develop.

## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Mentors are great. There's no reason not to give someone a small success fee
if they truly help you raise money (random email introductions to a VC they met
once at a cocktail party don't count). Sometimes it will make sense to compen-
sate mentors with options as long as you have some control over the vesting
of the options based on your satisfaction with the mentor's performance as an
ongoing adviser.

## How to Raise Money

Y.
our goal when you are raising financing should be to get several
term sheets. While we have plenty of suggestions, there is no single
way to do this, as financings come together in lots of different ways
and can be attributed to an outstanding strategy or just plain old
good luck. Venture capitalists (VCs) are not a homogeneous group;
what might impress one VC might turn off another. Although we
know what works for us and for our firm, each firm is different, so
make sure you know who you are dealing with, what their approach
is, and what kind of material they need during the fundraising
process. Following are some basic but by no means complete rules of
the road, along with some things that you shouldn't do.


### Do or Do Not-There Is No Try

In addition to being a small, green, hairy puppet, Yoda was a wise
man. His seminal statement to young Luke Skywalker is one we
believe every entrepreneur should internalize before hitting the fund-
raising trail. You must have the mind-set that you will succeed on
your quest.

When we meet people who say they are "trying to raise money,"
"testing the waters," or "exploring different options," this not only
is a turnoff but also often shows they've not had much success. Start
with an attitude of presuming success. If you don't, investors will
smell this uncertainty on you; it'll permeate your words and actions.

Not all entrepreneurs will succeed when they go out to raise
a financing. Failure is a key part of entrepreneurship, but, as with

<!-- PageNumber="19" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="20" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

many things in life, attitude impacts outcome and this is one of
those cases.

Note that this advice does not pertain to informal meetings with
investors about what you are doing. We meet with plenty of entrepre-
neurs who aren't raising money just to get to know them. However,
as soon as the switch flips to an active fundraising process, you must
be all in.


### Determine How Much You Are Raising

Before you hit the road, figure out how much money you are going
to raise. This will impact your choice of those you speak to in the
process. For instance, if you are raising a $500,000 seed round, you'll
talk to angel investors, seed-stage VCs, super angels, micro VCs, and
early-stage investors, including ones from very large VC funds. How-
ever, if you are going out to raise $10 million, you should start with
larger VC firms since you'll need a lead investor who can write at
least a $5 million check.

While you can create complex financial models that determine
that you need a specific amount of capital down to the penny to
become cash flow positive, we know one thing with complete cer-
tainty: these models will be wrong. Instead, focus on a length of
time you want to fund your company to get to the next meaningful
milestone. If you are just starting out, how long will it take you to
ship your first product? If you have a product in the market, how
long will it take to get to a certain number of users or a specific
revenue amount? Then, assuming no revenue growth; what is your
monthly spend, also known as burn rate, that you need to get to this
point? If you are starting out and think it'll take six months to get a
product to market with a team of eight people, you can quickly esti-
mate that you'll spend around $100,000 per month for six months.
Give yourself some time cushion (say, a year) and raise $1 million,
since it'll take you a few months to ramp up to a $100,000-per-month
burn rate.

The length of time you need varies dramatically by business. In a
seed stage software company, you should be able to make real prog-
ress in around a year. If you are trying to get a drug approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), you'll need at least sev-
eral years. Don't obsess about getting this exactly right-as with your
financial model, it's likely wrong (or approximate at best). Just make

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="21" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

sure you have enough cash to get to a clear point of demonstrable
success. That said, be careful not to overspecify the milestones that
you are going to achieve-you don't want them showing up in your
financing documents as specific milestones that you have to attain.

Be careful not to go out asking for an amount that is larger than
you need, since one of the worst positions you can be in during a
financing is to have investors interested, but be too far short of your
goal. For example, assume you are a seed-stage company that needs
$500,000 but you go out looking for $1 million. One of the questions
that the VCs and angels you meet with will probably ask you is: "How
much money do you have committed to the round?" If you answer
with "I have $250,000 committed," a typical angel may feel you're
never going to get there and will hold back on engaging just based
on the status of your financing. However, being able to say "I'm at
$400,000 on a $500,000 raise and we've got room for one or two
more investors" is a powerful statement to a prospective angel inves-
tor since most investors love to be part of an oversubscribed round.

Finally, we don't believe in ranges in the fundraising process.
When someone says they are raising $5 million to $7 million, our
first question is: "Is it $5 million or $7 million?" Though it might
feel comfortable to offer up a range in case you can't get to the high
end of it, presumably you want to raise at least the low number. The
range makes it appear like you are hedging your bets or that you
haven't thought hard about how much money you actually need to
raise. Instead, we always recommend stating that you are raising a
specific number. If you end up with more investor demand than you
can handle, you can always raise a larger amount of money.

Also keep in mind that the difference between $5 million and $7
million might not sound like much to you, but it could make all the
difference in the world to the VC you are speaking to. If the largest
first check a VC writes is $3 million, then a $5 million round means
they can be the lead investor. However, in a $7 million round, they
can only be a co-lead or a follower. While you should never change
the amount of money you are raising to entice a VC, keep in mind
that having a range makes your targeting and conversations murkier.


### Fundraising Materials

While the exact fundraising materials you will need can vary widely
by VC, there are a few basic things that you should create before you

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="22" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

hit the fundraising trail. At the minimum, you need a short descrip-
tion of your business, an executive summary, and a presentation that is
often not so fondly referred to as "a PowerPoint" despite the fact that
many of us are using Google Docs these days. Some investors will
ask for a business plan or a private placement memorandum; this is
more common in later-stage investments.

Once upon a time, physical form seemed to matter. In the
1980s, elaborate business plans were professionally printed at the
corner copy shop and mailed out. Today, virtually all materials
are sent via email. Quality still matters a lot, but it's usually in sub-
stance with appropriate form. Don't overdesign your information-
we can't tell you the number of times we've received a highly styl-
ized executive summary that was organized in such a way as to be
visually appealing, yet completely lacking in substance. Focus on
the content while making the presentation solid and able to stand
on its own.

Whatever you send us must be clear, concise, interesting, and
easy for us to process alone early in the morning in the darkness of
our office at home. If you need to talk us through it, you have lost
the battle before you've started. Do not make the common mistake
of thinking that you'll send us a teaser and then get to talk through
the details at a meeting. Realize that whatever you send a VC is often
both your first and last impression, so make it count.

Finally, while never required, many investors (such as us) respond
to things we can play with, so even if you are a very early-stage com-
pany, a prototype or demo is desirable.


#### Short Description of Your Business

You'll need a few paragraphs that you can email, often called the
elevator pitch, meaning you should be able to give it during the length
of time it takes for an elevator to go from the first floor to your pro-
spective investor's office. Don't confuse this with the executive sum-
mary, which we discuss next; rather, this is one to three paragraphs
that describe the product, the team, and the business very directly. It
doesn't need to be a separate document that you attach to an email;
this is the bulk of the email, often wrapped with an introductory
paragraph, especially if you know the person or are being referred
to the person, and a concluding paragraph with a very clear request
for whatever next step you want.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="23" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->


#### Executive Summary

The executive summary is a one- to three-page description of your
idea, product, team, and business. It's a short, concise, well-written
document that is the first substantive document and interaction
you'll likely have with a prospective investor with whom you don't
have a preexisting relationship. Think of the executive summary as
the basis for your first impression and expect it to be passed around
within a VC firm if there's any interest in what you are doing.

Work hard on the executive summary-the more substance you
can pack into this short document, the more a VC will believe that
you have thought critically about your business. It also is a direct
indication of your communication skills. A poorly written summary
that leaves out key pieces of information will cause the VC to assume
that you haven't thought deeply about some important issues or that
you are trying to hide bad facts about the business. Our inner gram-
mar nerds suggest you have someone not involved in your company
proofread your materials.

In the executive summary, include the problem you are solving
and why it's important to solve. Explain why your product is awe-
some, why it's better than what currently exists, and why your team is
the right one to pursue it. End with some high-level financial data to
show that you have aggressive but sensible expectations about how
your business will perform over time.

Your first communication with a VC is often an introductory
email, either from you or from someone referring you to the VC,
that is a combination of the short description of your business along
with the executive summary attached to the email. If your first inter-
action was a face-to-face meeting either at a conference, at a coffee
shop, or in an elevator, if a VC is interested he'll often say something
like "Can you send me an executive summary?" Do this the same day
that it is requested of you to start to build momentum to the next
step in the process.


#### Presentation

Once you've engaged with a VC firm, you'll quickly be asked either to
give or to email a presentation. This is usually a 10- to 20-page Power-
Point presentation consisting of a substantive overview of your busi-
ness. There are many different presentation styles and approaches,
and what you need will depend on the audience (one person, a VC

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="24" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

partnership, or 500 people at an investor day type of event). Your
goal with the presentation is to communicate the same information
as the executive summary, but using a visual presentation.

Over time, a number of different presentation styles have
emerged. A three-minute presentation at a local pitch event is just as
different from an eight-minute presentation at an accelerator's inves-
tor day as it is from a 30-minute presentation to a VC partnership.
Recognize your audience and tune your presentation to them. Real-
ize also that the deck you email as an overview can be different from
the one you present, even if you are covering similar material.

Work hard on the presentation flow and format. In this case,
form matters a great deal-it's amazing how much more positive
a response is to well-designed and well-organized slides, especially
if you have a consumer-facing product where user experience will
matter a lot for its success. If you don't have a good designer on
your team, find a freelance designer to help you turn your presen-
tation into something visually appealing. This is especially true
if you are creating a consumer-facing product. If you can't cre-
ate good-looking slides, how are you going to create a killer user
experience? Put some extra effort into this-it will pay off many
times over.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

"Less is more" when it comes to an investor presentation. There are only a few
key things most VCs look at to understand and get excited about a deal: the
problem you are solving, the size of the opportunity, the strength of the team, the
level of competition or competitive advantage that you have, your plan of attack,
and current status. Summary financials, use of proceeds, and milestones are
also important. Most good investor presentations can be done in 10 slides
or fewer.


### Business Plan

We haven't read a business plan in over 20 years. Sure, we still get
plenty of them, but it is not something we care about as we invest in
areas we know well, and as a result we much prefer demos and live
interactions. Fortunately, most business plans arrive in email these
days, so they are easy enough to ignore since one doesn't have to
physically touch them. However, realize that some VCs care a lot

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="25" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

about seeing a business plan, regardless of the current view by many
people that a business plan is an obsolete document.

The business plan is usually a 30-page-plus document that has
all sorts of sections and is something you would learn to write if you
went to business school. It goes into great detail about all facets of
the business, expanding on the executive summary to have compre-
hensive sections about the market, product, target customer, go-to-
market strategy, team, and financials.

While we think business plans prepared specifically for fundrais-
ing are a waste of time, we still believe that they are valuable docu-
ments for entrepreneurs to write while they are formulating their
businesses. There are lots of different approaches today, including
many that are user- or customer-centric, but the discipline of writing
down what you are thinking, your hypotheses about your business,
and what you believe will happen is still very useful.

Now, we aren't talking about a conventional business plan,
although this can be a useful approach. If you are a software com-
pany, consider some variant of the Lean Startup methodology that
includes the creation, launch, and testing of a minimum viable prod-
uct as a starting point. Instead of writing an extensive document, use
PowerPoint to organize your thoughts into clear sections, although
recognize that this is very different from the presentation you are
going to give potential investors.

You will occasionally be asked for a business plan. Be prepared
for this and know how you plan to respond, along with what you will
provide, if and when this comes up.


### Private Placement Memorandum

A private placement memorandum (PPM) is essentially a traditional busi-
ness plan wrapped in legal disclaimers that are often as long as the
plan itself. It's time consuming and expensive to prepare, and you
get the privilege of paying lawyers thousands of dollars to proofread
the document and provide a bunch of legal boilerplate to ensure
you don't say anything that you could get sued for later.

Normally, PPMs are generated only when investment bankers are
involved and are fundraising from large entities, banks, or late-stage
investors that demand a PPM. In the past few years, bankers have
often shifted to PowerPoint-type presentations with endless bullet
points, instead of prose, because they are easier to create and likely
easier to consume.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="26" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

We've seen plenty of early-stage companies hire bankers and
draft PPMs. To us, this is a waste of money and time. When we see an
email from a banker sending us a PPM for an early-stage company,
we automatically know that investment opportunity isn't for us and
almost always toss it in the circular file.

Our view is that if an early-stage company has hired a banker to
help with fundraising, either it has been unsuccessful in its attempt
to raise money and is hoping the banker can help it in a last-ditch
effort or it is getting bad advice from its advisers (who may be the
ones making a fee from marketing the deal via the PPM). While
many later-stage investors like to look at all the stuff they get from
investment bankers, we think this is a pretty weak approach for an
early-stage company.


#### Detailed Financial Model

The only thing that we know about financial predictions of startups
is that 100 percent of them are wrong. If you can predict the future
accurately, we have a few suggestions for other things you could be
doing besides starting a risky early-stage company. Furthermore, the
earlier stage the startup, the less accurate any predications will be.
While we know you can't predict your revenue with any degree of
accuracy (although we are always very pleased in that rare case where
revenue starts earlier and grows faster than expected), the expense
side of your financial plan is very instructive as to how you think
about the business.

You can't predict your revenue with any level of precision, but you
should be able to manage your expenses exactly to plan. Your finan-
cials will mean different things to different investors. In our case,
we focus on two things: (1) the assumptions underlying the revenue
forecast (which we don't need a spreadsheet for-we'd rather just
talk about them) and (2) the monthly burn rate or cash consump-
tion of the business. Since your revenue forecast will be wrong, your
cash flow forecast will be wrong. However, if you are an effective man-
ager, you'll know how to budget for this by focusing on lagging your
increase in cash spend behind your expected growth in revenue.

Other VCs are much more spreadsheet driven. Some firms (usu-
ally those with associates) may go so far as to perform discounted
cash flow analyses to determine the value of your business. Some
will look at every line item and study it in detail. Others only focus

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="27" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

on certain things that matter to them. For instance, what is your
head count over the next few quarters, and how fast do you expect
to acquire users or customers? Although none of us know your busi-
ness better than you do, VCs will apply their experience and frames
of reference to your financial model as they evaluate how well you
understand the financial dynamics of your business.

In later financing rounds, your company's historical financial
performance, underlying unit economics, cost structure, and future
financial plan will matter a lot more to your prospective VCs. At
this point, you've been in business for a while. You are now raising
money against your track record and the extrapolation of that into
the future, rather than just an idea, a dream, and a fantasy.


#### The Demo

Most VCs love demos. In the short time before we wrote this sec-
tion, we got to play with an industrial robot, wear a device that
tracked anxiety level, interact with software that measured the
number of times we smiled while we watched a video, saw a projec-
tion system that worked on curved walls with incredible fidelity,
gave real blood out of our arms for a new health analysis technol-
ogy, and played around with a Web service that figured out the
news we were interested in based on a new approach to leveraging
our social graphs. We learned more from the demos, especially
about our emotional interest in the products we played with, than
any document could communicate. Each of these demos also gave
us a chance to talk directly to the entrepreneurs about how they
thought about their current and future products, and we got a
clear view of the enthusiasm and obsession of the entrepreneurs
for what they are working on.

We believe the demo, a prototype, or an alpha is far more impor-
tant than a business plan or financial model for a very early-stage
company. The demo shows us your vision in a way we can interact
with. More important, it shows us that you can build something and
then show it off. We expect demos to be underfeatured, to be rough
around the edges, and to crash. We know that you'll probably throw
away the demo on the way to a final product and what we are invest-
ing in will evolve a lot. But like many 14-year-olds, we just want to play.

Demos are just as important in existing companies. If you have
a complex product, figure out a way to show it off in a short period

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="28" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

of time. We don't need to see every feature; use your demo to tell us
a story about the problem your product addresses. And give us the
steering wheel-we want to play with the demo, not just be passive
observers. While we are playing, watch us carefully because you'll
learn an enormous amount about us in that brief period of time
while you see how comfortable we are, whether our eyes light up,
and whether we really understand what you are pursuing.


### Due Diligence Materials

As you go further down the financing path, VCs will ask for addi-
tional information. If a VC offers you a term sheet, expect their law-
yers to ask you for a bunch of things such as capitalization tables,
contracts, material agreements, employment agreements, and board
meeting minutes. The list of documents requested during the for-
mal due diligence process (usually after signing of the term sheet,
but not always) can be long. For an example, see the "Resources"
page at www.venturedeals.com. The number of documents you will
actually have depends on how long you have been in business. Even
if you are a young company just starting up, we recommend that
before you go out to raise money, you organize all of these docu-
ments for quick delivery to a potential funding partner so you don't
slow down the process when they ask for them.

You should never try to hide anything with any of these fundrais-
ing materials. Although you are trying to present your company in
the best light possible, you want to make sure any issues you have are
clearly disclosed. Deal with any messy stuff up front. If a VC forgets
to ask for something early on, assume you will be asked for it before
the deal is done. If you happen to get something past a VC and get
funded, it will eventually come out that you weren't completely trans-
parent and your relationship will suffer. A good VC will respect full
disclosure early on and, if they are interested in working with you,
will actively engage to help you get through any challenges you have,
or at least give you feedback on why there are showstoppers that you
have to clear up before you raise money.


### Finding the Right VC

The best way to find the perfect VC is to ask your friends and other
entrepreneurs. They can give you unfiltered data about which VCs

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="29" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

they've enjoyed working with and who have helped build their busi-
nesses. It's also the most efficient approach, since an introduction
to a VC from an entrepreneur who knows both you and the VC is
always more effective than you sending a cold email to vcname@
vcfirm.com.

But what should you do if you don't have a large network for
this? Back in the early days of venture capital, it was very hard to
locate even the contact information for a VC, and you rarely found
them in the yellow pages, not even next to the folks who give payday
loans. Today, VCs have websites and blogs, tweet endlessly, and even
list their email addresses on their websites.

Entrepreneurs can discover a lot of information about their
potential future VC partners, well beyond the mundane contact
information. You'll be able to discover what types of companies
they invest in, what stage of growth they prefer to invest in, past suc-
cesses, failures, approaches, and strategies (at least their marketing
approaches), and bios on the key personnel at the firm.

If the VC has a social media presence, you'll be able to take all
of that information and infer things like their hobbies, theories on
investing, beer they drink, instruments they play, and type of build-
ing or facility-such as a bathroom-they like to endow at their local
universities. If you follow them on Foursquare, you can even figure
out what kind of food they like to eat.

While it may seem obvious, engaging a VC that you don't know
via social media can be useful as a starting point to develop a rela-
tionship. In addition to the ego gratification of having a lot of Twit-
ter followers (hint: now is the time to follow @jasonmendelson and
@bfeld if you aren't already), you'll start to develop an impression
and, more importantly, a relationship if you comment thoughtfully
on blog posts the VC writes. It doesn't have to be all business-
engage at a personal level, offer suggestions, interact, and follow the
best rule of developing relationships: "give more than you get." And
never forget the simple notion that if you want money, ask for advice.

Do your homework. When we get business plans from medical
tech companies or somebody insisting we sign a nondisclosure agree-
ment (NDA) before we review a business plan, we know that they did
absolutely zero research on our firm or us before they sent us the
information. At best, the submission doesn't rise to the top com-
pared to more thoughtful correspondences, and at worst it doesn't
even elicit a response from us.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="30" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

A typical VC gets thousands of inquiries a year. The vast majority
of these requests are from people whom the VC has never met and
with whom the VC has no relationship. Improve your chances of
having VCs respond to you by researching them, getting a referral
to them, and engaging with them in whatever way they seem to be
interested in.

Finally, don't forget this works both ways. You may have a super-
hot deal and as a result have your pick of VCs to fund your company.
Do your homework and find out who will be most helpful to your
success, has a temperament and style that will be compatible with
yours, and will ultimately be your best long-term partner. Remember
that the average length of a relationship between a VC and founder
is on par with the average length of a marriage in the United States.


### Finding a Lead VC

Assuming that you are talking with multiple potential investors, you
can generally categorize them into one of three groups: leaders, fol-
lowers, and everyone else. It's important to know how to interact
with each of these groups. If not, you not only will waste a lot of your
time but also might be unsuccessful in your fundraising mission.

Your goal is to find a lead VC. This is the firm that is going to give
you a term sheet, take a leadership role in driving to a financing, and
likely be your most active new investor. It's possible to have co-leads
(usually two, occasionally three) in a financing. It's also desirable to
have more than one VC competing to lead your deal without them
knowing who else you are talking to.

As you meet with potential VCs, you'll get one of four typical
vibes. First is the VC who is clearly interested and wants to lead. Next
is the VC who isn't interested and passes. These are the easy ones-
engage aggressively with the ones who want to lead and don't worry
about the ones who pass.

The other two categories-the "maybe" and the "slow no"-are
the hardest to deal with. The "maybe" seems interested, but doesn't
really step up his level of engagement. This VC seems to be hanging
around, waiting to see if there's any interest in your deal. Keep this per-
son warm by continually meeting and communicating with him, but
realize that this VC is not going to catalyze your investment. However,
as your deal comes together with a lead, this VC is a great one to bring
into the mix if you want to put a syndicate of several firms together.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="31" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

The "slow no" is the hardest to figure out. These VCs never actu-
ally say no, but are completely in react mode. They'll occasionally
respond when you reach out to them, but there is no perceived for-
ward motion on their part. You always feel like you are pushing on
a rope-there's a little resistance but nothing ever really moves any-
where. We recommend you think of these VCs as a "no" and don't
continue to spend time with them.

Keep your head up and stay optimistic throughout the process.
We realize how frustrating finding a lead VC can be. We also get
frustrated with VCs, who aren't transparent and deal in maybes and
act as slow nos. If it makes you feel any better, we face the same thing
when we go out to raise money from our investors. Most of all, learn
from all the feedback you get and don't take any of it personally.


### How VCs Decide to Invest

Let's explore how VCs decide to invest in a company and what the
process normally looks like. All VCs are different, so these are gen-
eralizations but more or less reflect the way that VCs make their
decisions.

The way that you get connected to a particular VC affects the
process that you go through. Some VCs will fund only entrepreneurs
with whom they have a prior connection. Other VCs prefer to be
introduced to entrepreneurs by other VCs. Some VCs invest only in
seasoned entrepreneurs and avoid working with first-time entrepre-
neurs, whereas others, like us, will fund entrepreneurs of all ages
and experience levels and will try to be responsive to anyone who
contacts us. Whatever the case is, you should determine quickly if
you reached a particular VC through her preferred channel or you
are swimming upstream from the beginning.

Next, you should understand the role of the person within the
VC firm who is your primary connection. If an associate reached out
to you via email, consider that his job is to scour the universe looking
for deals but that the associate probably doesn't have any real pull to
get a deal done. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't meet with her,
but also don't get overly excited until there is a general partner or
managing director at the firm paying attention to and spending real
time with you.

Your first few interactions with a VC firm will vary widely depend-
ing on the firm's style and who your initial contact is. However, at

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="32" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

some point it will be apparent that the VC has more than a passing
interest in exploring an investment in you and will begin a process
often known as due diligence. This isn't a formal legal or technical
diligence; rather, it's code for "I'm taking my exploration to the
next level."

You can learn a lot about the attitude and culture of a VC firm by
the way it conducts its diligence. For example, if you are raising your
first round of financing and you have no revenue and no product,
a VC who asks for a five-year detailed financial projection and then
proceeds to hammer you on the numbers is probably not someone
who has a lot of experience or comfort making early-stage invest-
ments. As mentioned before, we believe the only thing that can be
known about a pre-revenue company's financial projections is that
they are wrong.

During this phase, a VC will ask for a lot of things, such as pre-
sentations, projections, customer pipeline or targets, development
plan, competitive analysis, and team bios. This is all normal. In some
cases, the VCs will be mellow and accept what you've already created
in anticipation of the financing. In other cases, they'll make you run
around like a headless chicken and create a lot of busywork for you.
In either case, before you jump through hoops providing this infor-
mation, make sure a partner-level person (usually a managing direc-
tor or general partner) is involved and that you aren't just the object
of a fishing expedition by an associate.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If you feel like your VC is a proctologist, run for the hills.

While the VC firm goes through its diligence process on you, we
suggest you return the favor and ask for things like introductions to
other founders they've backed. Nothing is as illuminating as a dis-
cussion with other entrepreneurs who've worked with your potential
investor. Don't be afraid to ask for entrepreneurs the VC has backed
whose companies haven't worked out. Since you should expect that
a good VC will ask around about you, don't be afraid to ask other
entrepreneurs what they think of the VC.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="33" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->


### The Entrepreneur's Perspective

The best VCs will give you, either proactively or reactively, a list of all the entre-
preneurs they've worked with in the past and ask you to pick a few for reference
checks. The best reference checks are ones you can do where the company
went through hard times, maybe swapped out a founder for another CEO, or
even failed, as you will learn from these how the VC handled messy and adver-
sarial situations.

You'll go through multiple meetings, emails, phone calls, and
more meetings. You may meet other members of the firm or you may
not. You may end up going to the VC's offices to present to the entire
partnership on a Monday, a tradition known by many firms as the
Monday partner meeting. In other cases, as with our firm, if things
are heating up you'll meet with each of the partners relatively early
in the process in one-on-one or group settings.

As things unfold, either you'll continue to work with the VC in
exploring the opportunity or the VC will start slowing down the pace
of communication. Be very wary of the VC who is hot on your com-
pany, then warm, then cold, but never really says no. While some
VCs are quick to say no when they lose interest, many VCs don't
say no because either they don't see a reason to, they want to keep
their options open, they are unwilling to affirmatively pass on a deal
because they don't want to have to shut the door, or they are just
plain impolite and disrespectful to the entrepreneur.

Ultimately, VCs will decide to invest or not invest. If they do, the
next step in the process is for them to issue a term sheet.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If a VC passes on a deal with you, whether graciously or by not returning your
emails and your calls, do your best to politely insist on feedback as to why. This
is one of the most important lessons an entrepreneur can learn and is especially
useful during the fundraising cycle. Don't worry that someone is telling you that
your baby is ugly. Ask for the feedback, demand it, get it, absorb it, and learn
from it.

### Using Multiple VCs to Create Competition

Choice is power. Having multiple VCs interested in your company
will provide insight into how different firms work and give you the
negotiation leverage to improve the terms of the deal.

If you want to create a competitive process, allow at least six
months to raise money. If you start the process earlier than this, you
won't feel urgency to get a deal done, nor will your prospective inves-
tors. If you start with less time, you may not have enough time to get
the financing done before you run out of money. A short window to
get a financing done can lead to many VCs passing since they won't
have enough time to evaluate your company. In other cases, VCs will
sense desperation when you only have a few months left before run-
ning out of money, which doesn't help your negotiating position.

After you've started to engage with a particular VC, make sure
you understand their process. A few will tell you, but most won't.
After you've had a second meeting, ask what the process going for-
ward is. While you might get a vague answer, you'll often get some
clues as to what the next steps and decision points are.

Timing is everything. While it is hard enough to get multiple par-
ties interested, you also need to make sure that the timing of each of
their processes line up. It doesn't do you any good if you get three
VCs interested in you 18 months apart. If you have a sense of process,
you can bias your energy toward the firms with a longer process in an
effort to synchronize the delivery of term sheets.

Be careful to understand what a slow process actually means.
While annoying, many VCs have a slow process because they are bad
at saying no and prefer to string along entrepreneurs to give the VC
firm option value in the situation where a deal starts to heat up. If a
VC is having trouble giving you clear and timely feedback, or is reluc-
tant to be clear in their description, you may be speaking to some-
one who doesn't have the power in their firm to get a deal done.
That is why we always suggest that you interact, as much as possible,
with managing directors and general partners.

Some VCs will ask you who else you are talking to. If your goal is
to create a competitive process, never answer this question. If you do,
the next email a VC will send is one to someone at the firms you told
them you were talking to, asking what they think of you and your deal.
Sometimes this works in your favor, but only in cases where the firms
compete fiercely with each other for deals or in situations where firms

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="35" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How to Raise Money" -->

collaborate closely. Either way, it's better to stay quiet about other
conversations early on and only make connections between firms that
are known collaborators as term sheets start to fly.

Do your homework. Be as strategic in your fundraising as
you are with your business. Plan ahead. Talk to everyone you can
about which VCs to speak to, and don't waste your time with those
who don't invest in your stage or sector. Be up front and direct
and get as much information as you can during the fundraising
process.


### Closing the Deal

The most important part of the fundraising process is to close the
deal, raise the money, and get back to running your business. How
do you actually close the deal?

Separate it into two activities: the first is the signing of the term
sheet and the second is signing the definitive documents and getting
the cash. This book is primarily about getting a term sheet signed.
In our experience, most executed term sheets result in a financing
that closes. Reputable VCs, especially early-stage firms, can't afford
to have term sheets signed and then not follow through; otherwise,
they don't remain reputable for long.

This can be different for later-stage firms. Often, you'll agree to
a term sheet, albeit a nonbinding one, but you aren't done with the
deal process yet. Many later-stage firms have a final formal approval
step, known as their investment committee, before they actually
close a deal. In the past few years, we have seen several cases where
a signed term sheet from the fund wasn't actually approved by the
investment committee. In these cases, the company and VC pro-
ceeded as though the term sheet would lead to a deal and, after lots
of diligence and legal drafting, the investment committee turned
down the deal and the VC walked away, often putting the company
in a difficult situation.

The most likely situations that derail financings are when VCs
find unexpected bad facts about the company after term sheet sign-
ing. You should assume that a signed term sheet will lead to money
in the bank as long as there are no smoking guns in your company's
past, the investor is a professional one, and you don't do anything
stupid in the definitive document drafting process.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="36" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

The second part of closing the deal is the process of drafting
the definitive agreements. Generally, the lawyers do most of the
heavy lifting here. They will take the term sheet and start to negoti-
ate the 100-plus pages of documentation that are generated from
the term sheet. In the best-case scenario, you respond to due dili-
gence requests, and one day you are told to sign some documents.
The next thing you know, you have money in the bank and a new
board member with whom you are excited to work.

In the worst case, however, the deal blows up. Or perhaps the deal
closes, but there are hard feelings left on both sides. Throughout
the process, manage it on a daily basis. Don't let the lawyers behave
poorly, as this will only injure the future relationship between you
and your investor. Make sure that you are responsive with requests,
and never assume that because your lawyer is angry and says the
other side is horrible/stupid/evil/worthless that the VC even has a
clue what is going on. Many times, we've seen legal teams get com-
pletely tied up on an issue and want to kill each other when nei-
ther the entrepreneur nor the VC even cared or had any notion that
there was a dustup over the issue. Before you get emotional, make a
phone call or send an email to the VC and see what the real story is.

# Overview of the Term Sheet

A
t the end of 2005, during the dark ages when venture capital was
very much out of favor, we participated in a financing that was much
more difficult than it needed to be. All of the participants were to
blame, and ignorance of what really mattered in the negotiation
kept things going much longer than was necessary. We talked about
what to do and, at the risk of giving away super-top-secret venture
capital magic tricks, decided to write a blog series on Brad's blog
(Feld Thoughts-www.feld.com) that deconstructed a venture capital
term sheet and explained each section.

That blog series was the inspiration for this book. The next few
chapters cover the most frequently discussed terms in a venture capi-
tal term sheet. Many venture capitalists (VCs) love to negotiate hard
on every term as though the health of their children depended on
them getting the terms just right. Sometimes this is inexperience on
the part of the VC; often, it's just a negotiating tactic.

The specific language that we refer to is from actual term sheets.
In addition to describing and explaining the specific terms, we give
you examples of what to focus on and implications from the perspec-
tives of the company, VCs, and entrepreneurs.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

The term sheet is critical. What's in it usually determines the final deal structure.
Don't think of it as a letter of intent. Think of it as a blueprint for your future
relationship with your investor.

### The Key Concepts: Economics and Control

In general, there are only two things that VCs really care about when
making investments: economics and control. Economics refers to the
return the investors will ultimately get in a liquidity event, usually
either a sale of the company, a wind down, or an initial public offer-
ing (IPO), and the terms that have direct impact on this return.
Control refers to the mechanisms that allow the investors either to
affirmatively exercise control over the business or to veto certain
decisions the company can make. If you are negotiating a deal and
investors are digging their heels in on a provision that doesn't impact
the economics or control, they are often blowing smoke, rather than
elucidating substance.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Economics and control are important things to pay attention to, in and of them-
selves. They rule the day. An inexperienced VC will harp on other terms need-
lessly. You can give in on them or not, but the mere fact that a VC focuses on
unimportant terms is a sign of what that VC will be like to work with as an owner,
board member, and compensation committee member.

When companies are created, the founders receive common stock.
However, when VCs invest in companies, they purchase equity and
in the vast majority of cases receive preferred stock. In the following
chapters we'll be referring to terms that the preferred shareholders
are receiving.

As we described earlier, separate financings are usually referred
to as a series designated by a letter, such as Series A. The first round is
often called the Series A financing, although recently a new round
occurring before the Series A has appeared, called the Series Seed
financing. The letter is incremented in each subsequent financing,
so Series B financings follow Series A, and Series C financings follow
Series B. You'll occasionally see a number added onto the letter for
subsequent rounds, such as Series A-1 or Series B-2. This is generally
done to try to limit how far into the alphabet you go and is often
used when the same investors do subsequent rounds in a company
together. While we aren't aware of the world record for number of
financings in a private company, we have seen a Series K financing.

In the following chapters, we walk you through language for
each term and detailed examples. Let's get started by exploring the
economic terms.

## Economic Terms of the Term Sheet

W
hen discussing the economics of a venture capital deal, one
often hears the question, "What is the valuation?" While the valua-
tion of a company, determined by multiplying the number of shares
outstanding by the price per share, is one component of the deal,
it's a mistake to focus only on the valuation when considering the
economics of a deal.

In this chapter we discuss all of the terms that make up the eco-
nomics of the deal, including price, liquidation preference, pay-to-
play, vesting, the employee pool, and antidilution.


### Price

The first economic term, and the one most entrepreneurs focus on
more than any other, is the price of the deal. Following is the typical
way price is represented in a term sheet.

Price: $_ per share (the Original Purchase Price). The Origi-
nal Purchase Price represents a fully diluted pre-money valua-
tion of $ __ million and a fully diluted post-money valuation
of $_ million. For purposes of the above calculation and any
other reference to fully diluted in this term sheet, fully diluted
assumes the conversion of all outstanding preferred stock of the
Company, the exercise of all authorized and currently existing
stock options and warrants of the Company, and the increase of
the Company's existing option pool by [X] shares prior to this
financing.

<!-- PageNumber="39" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="40" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

A somewhat different way that price can be represented is by
defining the amount of the financing, which backs into the price.
For example:

Amount of Financing: An aggregate of $X million, representing
a __ % ownership position on a fully diluted basis, including
shares reserved for any employee option pool. Prior to the Clos-
ing, the Company will reserve shares of its Common Stock so
that __ % of its fully diluted capital stock following the issuance
of its Series A Preferred is available for future issuances to direc-
tors, officers, employees, and consultants.

While price per share is the ultimate measure of what is being paid
for the equity being bought, price is often referred to as valuation.

There are two different ways to discuss valuation: pre-money and
post-money. The pre-money valuation is what the investor is valuing
the company at today, before investment, while the post-money valu-
ation is simply the pre-money valuation plus the contemplated aggre-
gate investment amount. With this, you've encountered the first trap
that venture capitalists (VCs) often lead entrepreneurs into.

When a VC says, "I'll invest $5 million at a valuation of $20 mil-
lion," the VC usually means the post-money valuation. In this situ-
ation, the VC's expectation is that a $5 million investment will buy
25% of a $20 million post-money company. At the same time, an
entrepreneur might hear a $5 million investment at a pre-money valu-
ation of $20 million, which would buy only 20% of the $25 million
post-money company. The words are the same but the expectations
are very different.

The term sheet language usually spells this out in detail. However,
when you are starting the negotiation with the VC, you'll often have
a verbal discussion about price. How you approach this sets the tone
for a lot of the balance of the negotiation. By addressing the ambi-
guity up front, you demonstrate that you have knowledge about the
basic terms. The best entrepreneurs we've dealt with are presumptive
and say something like "I assume you mean $20 million pre-money."
This forces the VC to clarify, and if in fact she did mean $20 million
pre-money, it doesn't cost you anything in the negotiation.

The next part of price to focus on is the phrase fully diluted. Both
the company and the investor will want to make sure the company
has sufficient equity (or stock options) reserved to compensate and

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="41" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

motivate its workforce. This is also known as the employee pool or option
pool. The bigger the pool the better, right? Not so fast. Although a
large option pool will make it easier to give good option packages
to new hires while it being less likely that the company will run out
of available options, the size of the pool is taken into account in the
valuation of the company. This lowers the actual pre-money valua-
tion and is common valuation trap number two.

Let's stay with our previous example of a $5 million investment at
$20 million pre-money. Assume that you have an existing option pool
that has options representing 10% of the outstanding stock reserved
and unissued. The VCs suggest that they want to see a 20% option
pool. In this case, the extra 10% will come out of the pre-money valu-
ation, resulting in an effective pre-money valuation of $18 million.

There is no magic number for the option pool, and this is often
a key point of the pricing negotiation. The typical early-stage com-
pany option pool ends up in a range of 10% to 20%, with later-stage
companies having smaller option pools. If the investors believe that
the option pool of the company should be increased, they will insist
that the increase happens prior to the financing.

You have several negotiating approaches. You can fight the pool
size, trying to get the VCs to end up at 15% instead of 20%. Or you
can negotiate on the pre-money valuation; accept a 20% pool but
ask for a $22 million pre-money valuation. Or you can suggest that
the increase in the option pool gets added to the deal post-money,
which will result in the same pre-money valuation but a higher post-
money one.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

VCs will want to minimize their risk of future dilution as much as possible by
making the option pool as large as possible up front. When you have this nego-
tiation, you should come armed with an option budget. List out all of the hires
you plan on making between today and your next anticipated financing date and
the approximate option grant you think it will take to land each one of them. You
should be prepared to have an option pool with more options than your budget
calls for, but not necessarily by a huge margin. The option budget will be critical
in this conversation with your potential investor.

Another economic term that you will encounter, especially in
later-stage financings, is warrants associated with financings. As with

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="42" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

the stock option pool allocation, this is another way for an investor
to sneak in a lower valuation for the company. A warrant is similar to
a stock option; it is a right for an investor to purchase a certain num-
ber of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years. For
example, a 10-year warrant for 100,000 shares of Series A stock at $1
per share gives the warrant holder the option to buy 100,000 shares
of Series A stock at $1 per share anytime in the next decade, regard-
less of what the stock is worth at the moment in time the investor
avails himself of (or exercises) the warrant.

Warrants as part of a venture financing, especially in an early-
stage investment (where they are rare), tend to create a lot of
unnecessary complexity and accounting headaches down the road.
If the issue is simply one of price, we recommend the entrepreneur
negotiate for a lower pre-money valuation to try to eliminate the
warrants. Occasionally, this may be at cross purposes with existing
investors who, for some reason, want to artificially inflate the valua-
tion, since the warrant value is rarely calculated as part of the valu-
ation even though it impacts the future allocation of proceeds in a
liquidity event.

There is one type of financing-the bridge loan-in which war-
rants are commonplace. A bridge loan occurs when an investor is
planning to do a financing, but is waiting for additional investors
to participate. In the bridge loan scenario, the existing investor will
make the investment as convertible debt, which will convert into equity
at the price of the upcoming financing. Since the bridge loan inves-
tor took additional risk, he generally gets either a discount on the
price of the equity (usually up to 20%) or warrants that effectively
grant a discount (again usually up to 20%, although occasionally
more). In bridge round cases, it's not worth fighting these warrants
as long as they are structured reasonably.

The best way to negotiate a higher price is to have multiple VCs
interested in investing in your company. This is Economics 101; if
you have more demand (VCs interested) than supply (equity in your
company to sell), then price will increase. In early rounds, your new
investors will likely be looking for the lowest possible price that still
leaves enough equity in the founders' and employees' hands. In
later rounds, your existing investors will often argue for the highest
price for new investors in order to limit the dilution of the exist-
ing investors. If there are no new investors interested in investing
in your company, your existing investors will often argue for a price

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="43" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

equal to (flat round) or lower than (down round) the price of the
previous round. Finally, new investors will always argue for the lowest
price they think will enable them to get a financing done, given the
appetite (or lack thereof) of the existing investors for putting more
money into the company. As an entrepreneur, you are faced with
all of these contradictory motivations in a financing, reinforcing
the truism that it is incredibly important to pick your early investors
wisely, since they can materially help or hurt this process.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

The best Plan A has a great Plan B standing behind it. The more potential inves-
tors you have interested in investing in your company, the better your negotiat-
ing position is. Spend as much time on your best alternative to a negotiated
agreement (BATNA) as possible.

By now you may be wondering how VCs really value companies.
It is not an exact science regardless of the number of spreadsheets
involved. VCs typically take into account many factors when deciding
how to value a potential investment-some are quantifiable whereas
others are completely qualitative. Following are some of the differ-
ent factors, along with brief explanations of what impacts them.

· Stage of the company. Early-stage companies tend to have a valu-
ation range that is determined more by the experience of the
entrepreneurs, the amount of money being raised, and the
perception of the overall opportunity. As companies mature,
the historical financial performance and future financial pro-
jections start to impact valuation. In later-stage companies,
supply and demand for the financing combined with finan-
cial performance dominate, as investors are beginning to look
toward an imminent exit event.

· Competition with other funding sources. The simple time-tested
rule for the entrepreneur is "more is better." When VCs feel
that they are competing with other VCs for a deal, price tends
to increase. However, a word of caution-don't overplay com-
petition that doesn't exist. If you do and get caught, you'll
damage your current negotiating position, potentially lose the
existing investor that you have at the table, and, if nothing

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="44" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

else, lose all of your leverage in other aspects of the negotia-
tion. Our belief is that you should always negotiate honestly.
Over representing your situation rarely ends well.

· Experience of the entrepreneurs and leadership team. The more expe-
rienced the entrepreneurs, the less risk, and, correspondingly,
the higher the valuation.

· Size and trendiness of the market. There will be some pricing
influence depending on how large, or trendy, the market is
that you are playing in.

· The VC's natural entry point. Some VCs are early-stage investors
and will invest only at low price points. For example, we know
of one well-known early-stage investor who publicly states the
intention not to invest at a valuation above $10 million post-
money. Later-stage investors tend to be much less focused on
a specific price level and care more about the specific status
of the company. While VC firms often have stated strategies,
it's often the case that they will diverge from these strategies,
especially when markets heat up.

· Numbers, numbers, numbers. The numbers matter. Whether it is
past performance; predictions of the future; revenue; earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA);
cash burn; or head count, they each factor into the determina-
tion of price. That being said, don't believe everything your
MBA professor told you about DCF (discounted cash flow, for
those of you without an MBA), especially for early-stage compa-
nies. Remember, the only thing you know for sure about your
financial projections at the early stages is that they are wrong.

· Current economic climate. Though this is out of the control of
the entrepreneur, it weighs heavily on pricing. When the
macro economy or stock market is in the dumps, valuations
are lower. When the macro economy is growing quickly, valu-
ations go up. Specifically, valuations often expand when there
is future optimism forecasted about the macro economy.
However, these events are not tightly correlated, especially in
the technology sector.

Regardless of an investor's justification for the valuation they are
giving you, recognize that it's a guess stimulated by multiple factors.
While numbers matter more in the later stages, don't be insulted if
your valuation and a VC's valuation aren't the same, as each of you

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="45" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

is coming from a different perspective. Our best advice to entrepre-
neurs on maximizing price is to focus on what you can control and
get several different VCs interested in your financing.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

I encourage entrepreneurs not to take valuation personally. Just because VCs
say their take is that your business is worth $6 million, when your take is that
your business is worth $10 million, doesn't mean that they lack appreciation for
you as a CEO or your business's future potential. It means they are negotiating
a deal to their advantage, just as you would.


### Liquidation Preference

The liquidation preference is the next most important economic
term after price and impacts how the proceeds are shared in a liquid-
ity event, which is usually defined as a sale of the company or the
majority of the company's assets. The liquidation preference is espe-
cially important in cases in which a company is sold for less than the
amount of capital invested.

There are two components that make up what most people call
the liquidation preference: the actual preference and participation.
To be accurate, the term liquidation preference should pertain only to
money returned to a particular series of the company's stock ahead of
other series of stock. Consider, for instance, the following language:

Liquidation Preference: In the event of any liquidation or wind-
ing up of the Company, the holders of the Series A Preferred
shall be entitled to receive in preference to the holders of the
Common Stock a per share amount equal to [X] times the Orig-
inal Purchase Price plus any declared but unpaid dividends (the
Liquidation Preference).

This is the actual preference. In this language, a certain multiple
of the original investment per share is returned to the investor before
the common stock receives any consideration. For many years, a 1x
liquidation preference, or simply the amount of money invested,
was the standard. In 2001, as the Internet bubble burst, investors
often increased this multiple, sometimes as high as 10x (10 times

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="46" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

the amount of money invested). Over time, rational thought pre-
vailed and this number has generally returned to 1x, although you
will often see multiple preferences, also known as structure, appear in
later-stage or distressed financings.

The next thing to consider is whether the investors' shares are par-
ticipating. While many people consider the term liquidation preference
to refer to both the preference and the participation, it's important to
separate the concepts. There are three varieties of participation: full
participation, capped participation, and no participation.

Fully participating stock will receive its liquidation preference
(typically 1x, but it can be more) and then share in the liquidation
proceeds on an as-converted basis, where "as-converted" means as if
the stock were converted into common stock based on its conversion
ratio. The provision normally looks like this:

Participation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference
to the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock
and the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis.

Capped participation indicates that the stock will receive its liq-
uidation preference and then share in the liquidation proceeds on
an as-converted basis until a certain multiple return is reached. If the
return is greater than the cap, then the participation will not apply.
Sample language is as follows:

Participation: After the payment of the Liquidation Preference
to the holders of the Series A Preferred, the remaining assets
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock
and the Series A Preferred on a common equivalent basis, pro-
vided that the holders of Series A Preferred will stop partici-
pating once they have received a total liquidation amount per
share equal to [X] times the Original Purchase Price, plus any
declared but unpaid dividends. Thereafter, the remaining assets
shall be distributed ratably to the holders of the Common Stock.

One interesting thing to note in this section is the actual mean-
ing of the multiple of the original purchase price (the [X]). If the
participation multiple is three (three times the original purchase
price), it would mean that the preferred would stop participating

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="47" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

(on a per share basis) once 300% of its original purchase price was
returned, including any amounts paid out on the liquidation prefer-
ence. This is not an additional 3x return, but rather an additional
2x, assuming the liquidation preference was a 1x money-back return.
Perhaps this correlation with the actual preference is the reason the
term liquidation preference has come to include both the preference
and participation terms. If the series is not participating, it will not
have a paragraph that looks like the preceding ones.

No participation indicates that the stock doesn't participate after
receiving their liquidation preference. In this case, also known as a
"simple preferred" or "nonparticipating preferred," the investor has
a choice-they can either get their money back or they can convert
into common stock and get proceeds equal to their percentage of
ownership of the company on an as-converted basis.

We'll talk at length about conversion in Chapter 5, but keep in
mind that the holders of preferred can always convert their pre-
ferred stock into common stock if it benefits them. This happens
when a nonparticipating or capped participating preferred holder
would make more money by converting to common than if they took
their liquidation preference and participation (if any).

Since we've been talking about liquidation preferences, it's impor-
tant to define what a liquidation event is. Often, entrepreneurs think of
a liquidation event as a bad thing, such as a bankruptcy or a winding
down of the company. In VC-speak, a liquidation is actually tied to
a liquidity event in which the shareholders receive proceeds for their
equity in a company and includes mergers, acquisitions, or a change
of control of the company. As a result, the liquidation preference sec-
tion determines the allocation of proceeds in both good times and
bad. Standard language defining a liquidation event looks like this:

Liquidation Event: A merger, acquisition, sale of voting control
in which the shareholders of the Company do not own a major-
ity of the outstanding shares of the surviving corporation or sale
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall be
deemed to be a liquidation. Any acquisition agreement that pro-
vides for escrowed or other contingent consideration will pro-
vide that the allocation of such contingent amounts properly
accounts for the liquidation preference of the Preferred Stock.

Ironically, lawyers don't necessarily agree on a standard defi-
nition of a liquidation event. Jason once had an entertaining and

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="48" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

unpleasant debate during a guest lecture he gave at his alma mater
law school (University of Michigan, for those of you wondering) with
a partner from a major Chicago law firm. At the time, this partner
was teaching a venture class that semester and claimed that an initial
public offering (IPO) should be considered a liquidation event. His
theory was that an IPO was the same as a merger, that the company
was going away, and thus the investors should get their proceeds.
Even if such a theory were accepted by an investment banker who
would be willing to take the company public (there's not a chance,
in our opinion), it makes no sense, as an IPO is simply another fund-
ing event for the company, not a liquidation of the company. In fact,
in almost all IPO scenarios, the VC's preferred stock is converted to
common stock as part of the IPO, eliminating the issue around a
liquidity event in the first place.

Let's see how this plays out in real life with some examples. To
keep it simple, let's assume that there has been only one round of
financing (a Series A investment) of $5 million at a $10 million pre-
money valuation. The post-money is $15 million in this case. The
Series A investors own 33.3% of the company ($5 million/$15 mil-
lion), and the entrepreneurs own 66.7% of the company. We are
going to look at four scenarios:

Case 1: The Series A stock has a 1x liquidation preference and
no participation;

Case 2: The Series A stock has a 2x liquidation preference and
no participation;

Case 3: The Series A stock has a 1x liquidation preference and is
fully participating (no cap); and

Case 4: The Series A stock has a 1x liquidation preference and is
participating up to a 3x cap.

For the ease of math, we'll also round the ownership numbers to
33% and 67%, respectively, instead of dealing with repeating deci-
mals. In the real world, spreadsheets come in handy here.

Now, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for
$5 million.

Notice that the preferred holders, so long as they have a 1x
liquidation preference (regardless of any participation features),

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="49" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

have the right to the entire consideration of the deal given that they
invested $5 million and the deal size doesn't clear the investment
amount. With companies that have raised a lot of money, any acquisi-
tion that doesn't clear the invested capital leaves the common shut
out of the proceeds. You'll hear this mentioned as the liquidation
preference overhang, which is the amount of money that needs to be
returned to investors to satisfy all liquidation preferences before the
common holders begin to receive some of the proceeds.

Now, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for
$15 million.

Case 1: 1x preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either take
its $5 million liquidation preference and be done, or convert
to common and take 33% of the proceeds, which in this case
is also $5 million. Note that the common gets $10 million
here.

Case 2: 2x preference, nonparticipating. The Series A can either
take their 2x preference, which is $10 million, or convert
to common and take 33%, which is $5 million. In this case,
the Series A takes the $10 million, leaving $5 million to the
common, which is half of what they would have made in
Case 1.

Case 3: 1x preference, participating. In this case, the Series A inves-
tors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remain-
ing amount, or $3.3 million (33% of $10 million) for a total
return of $8.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $10
million, or $6.7 million. Notice that in a fully participating
security, there is never any reason for the preferred to convert.
Think of this situation as having your cake and eating it also.

Case 4: 1x preference, participating with a 3x cap. In this case, the
preferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be
the same as Case 3.

Now, assume that the company has an offer to be acquired for
$30 million.

Case 1: 1x preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A
converts and gets 33%, or $10 million, and the common will

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="50" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

get 67%, or $20 million. If the Series A did not convert, they
would only receive $5 million, which is why it converts.

Case 2: 2x preference, nonparticipating. In this case, the Series A
investors will get 33%, or $10 million, and the common will
get 67%, or $20 million. Note that both the conversion and
nonconversion cases lead to the same allocation of proceeds.

Case 3: 1x preference, participating. In this case, the Series A inves-
tors will get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remain-
ing amount, or $8.3 million (33% of $25 million) for a total
return of $13.3 million. The common will get 67% of the $25
million, or $16.7 million.

Case 4: 1x preference, participating with a 3x cap. In this case, the
preferred will not reach the cap ($15 million), so this will be
the same as Case 3. The preferred will not convert and will
take $13.3 million, with the common getting $16.7 million.

Finally, assume the purchase price is $100 million.

Case 1: 1x preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will
get 33%, or $33 million, and the common will get 67%, or
$67 million. The Series A converts, as otherwise it would only
receive $5 million.

Case 2: 2x preference, nonparticipating. The Series A investors will
get 33%, or $33 million, and the entrepreneurs will get 67%,
or $67 million. The Series A again converts; otherwise, it
would only receive $10 million.

Case 3: 1x preference, participating. Again, the Series A investors
get the first $5 million and then 33% of the remaining $95
million, or $31.35 million, for a total of $36.35 million.
The common get 67% of the remaining $95 million, or
$63.65 million.

Case 4: 1x preference, participating with a 3x cap. In this example,
the Series A makes a return better than 3x ($15 million),
so the participation doesn't happen and the results are the
same as in Cases 1 and 2.

As you can see from this example, the participation feature has
a lot of impact at relatively low outcomes and less impact (on a

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="51" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

percentage of the deal basis) at higher outcomes. The participation
feature will also matter a lot more as more money is raised that has
the participation feature (e.g., Series B and C). To understand this,
let's do one last example, this time of a company that has raised
$50 million where the investors own 60% and the entrepreneurs
own 40%. Assume the company is being acquired for $100 million.

Case 1: 1x preference, nonparticipating. The investors can either take
$50 million or convert. They convert, since doing so results
in them getting $60 million. The common gets $40 million.

Case 2: 2x preference, nonparticipating. The investors will get $100
million, or all of the consideration, since it is 2x their invested
capital. The common gets nothing. Ouch.

Case 3: 1x preference, participating. Investors get the first $50 mil-
lion and then 60% of the remaining $50 million ($30 mil-
lion) for a total of $80 million. The common gets 40% of the
remaining $50 million, or $20 million. Again, ouch.

Case 4: 1x preference, participating with a 3x cap. Since the investors
won't make greater than 3x ($150 million) on this deal, this
is the same as Case 3.

Liquidation preferences are usually easy to understand and assess
when dealing with a Series A term sheet. It gets much more compli-
cated to understand what is going on as a company matures and
sells additional series of equity, since understanding how liquidation
preferences work between the various series is often mathematically,
and structurally, challenging. As with many VC-related issues, the
approach to liquidation preferences among multiple series of stock
varies and is often overly complex for no apparent reason.

There are two primary approaches:

1\. The follow-on investors will stack their preferences on top of
each other (known as stacked preferences) where Series B gets
its preference first, then Series A.

2\. The series are equivalent in status (known as pari passu or
blended preferences) so that Series A and B share proratably
until the preferences are returned.

Determining which approach to use is a black art that is influ-
enced by the relative negotiating power of the investors involved,

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="52" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

ability of the company to go elsewhere for additional financing, eco-
nomic dynamics of the existing capital structure, and the current
phase of the moon.

Let's look at an example. This time, our example company has
raised two rounds of financing, a Series A ($5 million invested at
a $10 million pre-money valuation) and a Series B ($20 million
invested at a $30 million pre-money valuation). Now, let's deal with a
low outcome, one where the liquidation preference is going to come
into play, namely a sale of the company for $15 million.

If the preference is stacked, the Series B investors will get the
entire $15 million. In fact, in this case it won't matter what the pre-
money valuation of the Series B was; they'll get 100% of the consid-
eration regardless.

However, if the preference is blended, the Series A will get 20%
of every dollar returned (in this case $3 million) and the Series B
will get 80% of every dollar returned (or $12 million), based on their
relative amounts of the capital invested in the company.

In each of these cases the entrepreneurs will receive nothing,
regardless of whether the preference is participating or nonpartici-
pating, since the preference is $25 million and the company is being
sold for $15 million, or less than the preference.

Note that investors get either the liquidation preference and
participation amounts (if any) or what they would get on a fully
converted common holding, at their election; they do not get both.
Realize, however, that in the fully participating case the investors get
their participation amount and then receive what they would get on
a fully converted common holding basis.

In early-stage financings, it's actually in the best interest of both
the investor and the entrepreneur to have a simple liquidation pref-
erence and no participation. In future rounds, the terms are often
inherited from the early-stage terms. So if you have a participating
preferred in a seed round, you could expect to have a participating
preferred in all subsequent rounds. In this case, if the seed inves-
tor doesn't participate in future rounds, his economics in many out-
comes could actually be worse with the participation feature. While
the early investor might think he is negotiating a great deal for him-
self, early investors end up looking like the common holders (in
terms of returns) since their preference amounts are so small. As a
result, we recommend entrepreneurs and our VC co-investors keep
it simple and lightweight in early rounds.

Most professional investors will not want to gouge a company
with excessive liquidation preferences since the greater the liquida-
tion preference, the lower the potential value of the management
or employee equity. There's a fine balance here and each case is
situation specific, but a rational investor will want a combination of
the best price while ensuring maximum motivation of management
and employees. Obviously, what happens in the end is a negotia-
tion and depends on the stage of the company, bargaining strength,
and existing capital structure; but in general most companies and
their investors will reach a reasonable compromise regarding these
provisions. Ultimately, reputable investors will rarely leave the man-
agement team with nothing on a liquidation event that is below the
liquidation preferences despite what the legal documents dictate, a
situation called a management carve-out, which we will discuss later.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Liquidation preference is a critical term that is part of most equity financings
other than small angel financings. Participating preferred deals have become
an unfortunate standard over the years where VCs have essentially decided on
a new standard floor for deals that require the repayment of principal as well as
a common stock interest in the company on the sale of a company. In the mid-
1990s, companies used to negotiate so-called kick-outs whereby participation
rights went away as long as the company had achieved a meaningful return for
the VC (2x to 3x). Entrepreneurs should band together to reinstate this as a
standard!

Anything other than a straight participating preferred security, such as mul-
tiple preferences, is just greedy on the part of VCs and should be a red flag to
you about the investor.


### Pay-to-Play

The pay-to-play provision is another important economic term that is
usually relevant in a down round financing and can be very useful to
the entrepreneur in situations where the company is struggling and
needs another financing. A typical pay-to-play provision follows:

Pay-to-Play: In the event of a Qualified Financing (as defined
below), shares of Series A Preferred held by any Investor which
is offered the right to participate but does not participate fully

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="54" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

in such financing by purchasing at least its pro rata portion as
calculated above under "Right of First Refusal" below will be
converted into Common Stock.

A Qualified Financing is the next round of financing after the
Series A financing by the Company that is approved by the
Board of Directors who determine in good faith that such por-
tion must be purchased pro rata among the stockholders of the
Company subject to this provision. Such determination will be
made regardless of whether the price is higher or lower than any
series of Preferred Stock.

At the turn of the millennium, a pay-to-play provision was rarely
seen. After the Internet bubble burst in 2001, it became ubiquitous.
Interestingly, this is a term that most companies and their investors
can agree on if they approach it from the right perspective.

In a pay-to-play provision, investors must keep participating pro-
ratably in future financings (paying) in order to not have their pre-
ferred stock converted to common stock (playing) in the company.

There are various levels of intensity of the pay-to-play provi-
sion. The preceding one is pretty aggressive when compared to this
softer one:

If any holder of Series A Preferred Stock fails to participate
in the next Qualified Financing (as defined below), on a pro
rata basis (according to its total equity ownership immediately
before such financing) of their Series A Preferred investment,
then such holder will have the Series A Preferred Stock it owns
converted into Common Stock of the Company. If such holder
participates in the next Qualified Financing but not to the full
extent of its pro rata share, then only a percentage of its Series
A Preferred Stock will be converted into Common Stock (under
the same terms as in the preceding sentence), with such per-
centage being equal to the percent of its pro rata contribution
that it failed to contribute.

When determining the number of shares held by an Investor or
whether this "Pay-to-Play" provision has been satisfied, all shares

tled to assign its rights to participate in this financing and future

<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

financings to its affiliated funds and to investors in the Investor
and/or its affiliated funds, including funds that are not current
stockholders of the Company.

We believe that pay-to-play provisions are generally good for the
company and its investors. It causes the investors to stand up at the
time of their original investment and agree to support the company
during its life cycle. If they do not, the stock they have is converted
from preferred to common and they lose the rights associated with
the preferred stock. When our co-investors push back on this term,
we ask: "Why? Are you not going to fund the company in the future
if other investors agree to?" Remember, this is not a lifetime guaran-
tee of investment; rather, if other prior investors decide to invest in
future rounds in the company, there will be a strong incentive for
all of the prior investors to invest or subject themselves to total or
partial conversion of their holdings to common stock. A pay-to-play
term ensures that all the investors agree in advance to the rules of
engagement concerning future financings.

The pay-to-play provision impacts the economics of the deal by
reducing liquidation preferences for the nonparticipating investors.
It also impacts the control of the deal since it reshuffles the future
preferred shareholder base by ensuring that only the committed
investors continue to have preferred stock and the corresponding
rights that go along with preferred stock.

When companies are doing well, the pay-to-play provision is
often waived since a new investor wants to take a large part of the
new round. This is a good problem for a company to have, as it typi-
cally means there is an up-round financing, existing investors can
help drive company-friendly terms in the new round, and the inves-
tor syndicate increases in strength by virtue of new capital (and, pre-
sumably, another helpful co-investor) in the deal.

The pay-to-play provision may not be appropriate, especially in
early rounds if you have investors who generally do not participate
in follow on rounds as a matter of business practice. For instance, if
a micro VC or seed fund leads your round, they often don't ever par-
ticipate in future funding rounds. In these cases, a pay-to-play provi-
sion will inappropriately penalize them in the future for supporting
you at the beginning when you critically needed their funding. Make
sure that you understand the future funding dynamics of your VC
partner and treat them accordingly.

## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

This pay-to-play provision is pretty good for you as an entrepreneur, at least as
it's described here. Conversion to common is no big deal in the grand scheme
of things. What you want to avoid is a pay-to-play scenario where your VC has
the right to force a recapitalization of the company (e.g., a financing at a $0
pre-money valuation, or something suitably low) if fellow investors don't play
into a new round.

A provision like this can be particularly bad for less sophisticated angel
investors (e.g., your friends and family) if they don't have the understanding or
resources to back up their initial investment with future follow-on investments,
and can make for uncomfortable conversations around family events.

There are many circumstances where reasonable investors who like the
company can't or won't participate in a financing-their venture fund is over,
or they are strategic or angel investors and don't have the funds or charter to
continue investing-and you and they shouldn't be punished excessively for not
participating (remember, a recapitalization hurts you, too, even if you get new
options, which always carry vesting, to "top you off"). But conversion to com-
mon for lack of follow-on investment is appropriate.


### Vesting

Although vesting is a simple concept, it can have profound and
unexpected implications. Typically, stock and options will vest over
four years. This means that you have to be around for four years to
own all of your stock or options (from this point forward, we'll sim-
ply refer to the equity that the entrepreneurs and employees receive
as stock, although exactly the same logic applies to options). If you
leave the company before the end of the four-year period, the vest-
ing formula applies and you get only a percentage of your stock. As
a result, many entrepreneurs view vesting as a way for VCs to control
them, their involvement, and their ownership in a company, which,
while it can be true, is only a part of the story.

A typical stock-vesting clause looks as follows:

Stock Vesting: All stock and stock equivalents issued after the
Closing to employees, directors, consultants, and other service
providers will be subject to vesting provisions below unless dif-
ferent vesting is approved by the majority (including at least one
director designated by the Investors) consent of the Board of

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="57" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

Directors (the "Required Approval"): 25 percent to vest at the
end of the first year following such issuance, with the remain-
ing 75 percent to vest monthly over the next three years. The
repurchase option shall provide that upon termination of the
employment of the shareholder, with or without cause, the Com-
pany or its assignee (to the extent permissible under applicable
securities law qualification) retains the option to repurchase at
the lower of cost or the current fair market value any unvested
shares held by such shareholder. Any issuance of shares in excess
of the Employee Pool not approved by the Required Approval
will be a dilutive event requiring adjustment of the conversion
price as provided above and will be subject to the Investors' first
offer rights.

The outstanding Common Stock currently held by \_and\_
(the "Founders") will be subject to similar vesting terms pro-
vided that the Founders shall be credited with [one year] of
vesting as of the Closing, with their remaining unvested shares
to vest monthly over three years.

Industry standard vesting for early-stage companies is a one-year
vesting cliff and monthly vesting thereafter for a total of four years.
This means that if you leave before the first year is up, you haven't
vested any of your stock. After a year, you have vested 25% (that's the
cliff). Then you begin vesting monthly (or quarterly, or annually)
over the remaining period. If you have a monthly vest with a one-
year cliff and you leave the company after 18 months, you'll have
vested 37.5% (or 18/48) of your stock.

Often, founders will get somewhat different vesting provisions
than the rest of the employees. A common term is the second para-
graph of the example clause, where the founders receive one year of
vesting credit at the closing of the financing and then vest the bal-
ance of their stock over the remaining 36 months. This type of vest-
ing arrangement is typical in cases where the founders have started
the company a year or more earlier than the VC investment and
want to get some credit for existing time served. In cases where the
founders started the company within a year of the first VC invest-
ment, they will occasionally be able to argue for vesting back to the
inception of the company.

Unvested stock typically disappears into the ether when some-
one leaves the company. The equity doesn't get reallocated; rather, it

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="58" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

gets reabsorbed and everyone (VCs, stockholders, and option hold-
ers) benefits ratably from the increase in ownership, also known as
reverse dilution. In the case of founders' stock, the unvested stuff just
vanishes. In the case of unvested employee options, it usually goes
back into the option pool to be reissued to future employees.

In some cases, founders own their stock outright through a pur-
chase at the time that the company is established. While the descrip-
tion of what happens to this founders' stock is often referred to as
vesting, it's actually a buy-back right of the company. Though there
are technically the same outcomes, the legal language around this is
somewhat different and matters for tax purposes.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

How a founder's stock vests is important. Although simple vesting can work,
you should consider alternative strategies such as allowing you to purchase your
unvested stock at the same price as the financing if you leave the company,
protecting your position for a termination "without cause," or treating your vest-
ing as a clawback with an Internal Revenue Code Section 83(b) election so you
can lock in long-term capital gains tax rates early on (which is discussed later
in this book).

A key component of vesting is defining what, if anything, hap-
pens to vesting schedules upon a merger. Single-trigger acceleration
refers to automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger. Double-trigger
acceleration refers to two events needing to take place before acceler-
ated vesting, specifically an acquisition of the company combined
with the employee in question being fired by the acquiring company.

In VC-funded deals, a double trigger is much more common
than a single trigger. Acceleration on change of control is often a
contentious point of negotiation between founders and VCs, as the
founders will want to get all their stock in a transaction-"Hey, we
earned it!"-and VCs will want to minimize the impact of the out-
standing equity on their share of the purchase price. Most acquirers
will want there to be some forward-looking incentive for founders,
management, and employees, so they usually prefer some unvested
equity to exist to help motivate folks to stick around for a period of
time post acquisition. In the absence of this, the acquirer will include
a separate management retention incentive as part of the deal value.
Since this management retention piece is included in the value of

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="59" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

the transaction, it effectively reduces the consideration that gets
allocated to the equity owners of the company, including the VCs
and any founders who are no longer actively involved in the com-
pany. This often frustrates VCs since it puts them at cross-purposes
with management in an acquisition negotiation-everyone should
be negotiating to maximize the value for all shareholders, not just
specifically for themselves. Although the actual legal language is not
very interesting, it is included here:

In the event of a merger, consolidation, sale of assets, or other
change of control of the Company and should an Employee
be terminated without cause within one year after such event,
such person shall be entitled to [one year] of additional vesting.
Other than the foregoing, there shall be no accelerated vesting
in any event.

Structuring acceleration on change-of-control terms used to be
a huge deal in the 1990s when pooling of interests was an accepted
form of accounting treatment, since there were significant con-
straints on any modifications to vesting agreements. Pooling was
abolished in early 2000, and under current acquisition accounting
treatment (also known as purchase accounting) there is no meaning-
ful accounting impact in a merger of changing the vesting arrange-
ments (including accelerating vesting). As a result, we usually recom-
mend a balanced approach to acceleration such as a double trigger
with one-year acceleration and recognize that this will often be nego-
tiated during an acquisition. It's important to recognize that many
VCs have a distinct point of view on this; some VCs will never do a
deal with single-trigger acceleration, whereas some VCs don't really
care very much. As in any negotiation, make sure you are not nego-
tiating against a point of principle, as VCs will often say, "That's how
it is and we won't do anything different."

Recognize that vesting works for the founders as well as the VCs.
We have been involved in a number of situations where one founder
didn't stay with the company very long either by choice or because
the other founders wanted her to leave the company. In these situa-
tions, if there hadn't been vesting provisions, the person who didn't
stay at the company would have walked away with all of her stock and
the remaining founders would have had no differential ownership
going forward. By vesting each founder, there is a clear incentive to

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="60" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

work your hardest and participate constructively in the team, beyond
the elusive founder's moral imperative. The same rule applies to
employees; since equity is another form of compensation, vesting is
the mechanism to ensure the equity is earned over time.

Time to exit has a huge impact on the relevancy of vesting. In the
late 1990s, when companies often reached an exit event within two
years of being founded, the vesting provisions, especially accelera-
tion clauses, mattered a huge amount to the founders. In a market
where the typical gestation period of an early-stage company is five
to seven years, most people, especially founders and early employees
who stay with a company, will be fully (or mostly) vested at the time
of an exit event.

While it's easy to set vesting up as a contentious issue between
founders and VCs, we recommend the founding entrepreneurs view
vesting as an overall alignment tool-for themselves, their cofound-
ers, early employees, and future employees. Anyone who has expe-
rienced an unfair vesting situation will have strong feelings about
it; a balanced approach and consistency are key to making vesting
provisions work long-term in a company.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

While single-trigger acceleration might seem appealing, double-trigger accel-
eration with some boundaries makes a lot of sense. Any entrepreneur who has
been on the buy side of an acquisition will tell you that having one or two years'
worth of guaranteed transition on the part of an acquired management team is
critical to an acquisition's financial success.


### Exercise Period

One provision that is not generally found in term sheets but that is
closely aligned with vesting is the concept of an exercise period. Once
stock is vested, a holder may exercise the option by paying the pur-
chase price to the company. In other words, if you have an option for
1,000 shares of stock at $0.10 a share, you can pay $100 to the com-
pany (after all the shares have vested) and own the stock outright.
Often, current employees of a company don't do this, as they want
to see how successful the company will be before they use funds to

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="61" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

purchase stock, although if the cost of exercising is low enough
there's a significant tax advantage by exercising the options, as you'll
now own stock that will be subject to capital gains tax treatment,
instead of options which are subject to ordinary income tax treatment.

However, once a person leaves a company, the exercise period
determines how long the departed employee has to purchase their
stock. Historically, this time period has been 90 days. If you leave the
company for any reason (voluntarily or not), then you have up to
90 days to pay the $100 to the company for the stock; otherwise, the
stock would be forfeited and returned to the stock option plan to be
granted to other employees.

There have been recent efforts to change this, as some feel
it's not fair for recently departed employees to have to pay for
their options within 90 days or forfeit the stock they earned dur-
ing their employment. There are some companies which have
changed their exercise periods to the maximum legal amount,
which is 10 years from the date of grant.

As a current topic, it will be interesting to see how this all works
out. What concerns us about the extension of the exercise period is
that it allows people to change jobs frequently and acquire options
in a number of companies, undermining the retention benefits
of options. Furthermore, the ultimate balance of equity between
early employees who leave within a year or two, but hold on to their
options for a decade can get out of alignment with later employees,
who stay longer, but start with less options.

At this point, we tend to prefer to deal with this issue on a case-
by-case basis. If the employee leaving merits this type of treatment,
the company can always choose to extend the exercise period as part
of the termination agreement.


### Employee Pool

Another economic term that matters, but is often not focused on
until the end of the negotiation, is the employee pool (also known as
the option pool). The employee pool is the amount of the company
that is reserved for future issuance to employees. Typical language
follows:

Employee Pool: Prior to the Closing, the Company will reserve
shares of its Common Stock so that percent of its fully diluted

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="62" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

capital stock following the issuance of its Series A Preferred is
available for future issuances to directors, officers, employees,
and consultants. The term "Employee Pool" shall include both
shares reserved for issuance as stated above, as well as current
options outstanding, which aggregate amount is approximately
% of the Company's fully diluted capital stock following the
issuance of its Series A Preferred.

The employee pool is called out in a separate section in order to
clarify the capital structure and specifically define the percentage of
the company that will be allocated to the option pool associated with
the financing. Since a capitalization table is almost always included
with the term sheet, this section is redundant, but exists so there is
no confusion about the size of the option pool.

It is important to understand the impact of the size of the pool
on the valuation of the financing. As with pre-money and post-money
valuations, VCs often sneak in additional economics for themselves
by increasing the amount of the option pool on a pre-money basis.

Let's go through an example. Assume that a $2 million financing
is being done at a $10 million post-money valuation. In this case, the
new investors get 20% of the company for $2 million and the effec-
tive post-money valuation is $10 million. Before the financing there
is a 10% unallocated option pool. However, in the term sheet, the
investors put a provision that the post financing unallocated option
pool will be 20%. This results in a post financing ownership split of
20% to the new investors, 60% to the old shareholders, and an unal-
located employee pool of 20%.

In contrast, if the 10% option pool that previously existed was
simply rolled over, the post-money allocation would still be 20% to
new investors, but the old shareholders would get 70% and the unal-
located option pool would be 10%.

While in both cases the investors end up with 20%, the old share-
holders have 10% less ownership in the case of the 20% option pool.
Although the additional ownership will ultimately end up in the
hands of future employees, it is effectively coming out of the old
shareholders rather than being shared between the new investors
and the old shareholders. This will result in a lower price per share
for the new investors and effectively a lower pre-money valuation.

If the VC is pushing for a larger option pool to come out of the
pre-money valuation but the entrepreneur feels that there is enough

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="63" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

in the pool to meet the company's needs over the time frame of
this financing, the entrepreneur can say, "Look, I strongly believe we
have enough options to cover our needs. Let's go with it at my pro-
posed level and if we should need to expand the option pool before
the next financing, we will provide full anti-dilution protection for
you to cover that."


### Antidilution

The final key economic provision is antidilution. A typical antidilu-
tion clause in a term sheet follows:

Antidilution Provisions: The conversion price of the Series A
Preferred will be subject to a [full ratchet/broad-based/narrow
based weighted average] adjustment to reduce dilution in the
event that the Company issues additional equity securities-
other than shares (i) reserved as employee shares described
under the Company's option pool; (ii) shares issued for con-
sideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consolidation,
acquisition, or similar business combination approved by the
Board; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or
leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement, or debt
financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved
by the Board; and (iv) shares with respect to which the holders
of a majority of the outstanding Series A Preferred waive their
antidilution rights-at a purchase price less than the applicable
conversion price. In the event of an issuance of stock involving
tranches or other multiple closings, the antidilution adjustment
shall be calculated as if all stock was issued at the first closing.
The conversion price will also be subject to proportional adjust-
ment for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitali-
zations, and the like.

Yeah, we agree-that's a mouthful. It's also a clause that often
trips up entrepreneurs. While the antidilution provision is used to
protect investors in the event a company issues equity at a lower valu-
ation than in previous financing rounds, it is also an excuse for law-
yers to use a spreadsheet. There are two varieties: weighted average
antidilution and ratchet-based antidilution.

Full ratchet antidilution means that if the company issues shares
at a price lower than the price for the series with the full ratchet

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="64" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

provision, then the earlier round price is effectively reduced to
the price of the new issuance. One can get creative and do partial
ratchets, such as half ratchets or two-thirds ratchets, which are less
harsh but rarely seen.

Full ratchets came into vogue in the 2001-2003 time frame when
down rounds were all the rage, but the most common antidilution
provision is based on the weighted average concept, which takes
into account the magnitude of the lower-priced issuance, not just
the actual valuation. In a full ratchet world, if the company sold one
share of its stock to someone for a price lower than the previous
round, all of the previous round stock would be repriced to the new
issuance price. In a weighted average world, the number of shares
issued at the reduced price is considered in the repricing of the pre-
vious round. Mathematically (and this is where the lawyers get to
show off their math skills-although you'll notice there are no expo-
nents or summation signs anywhere) it works as follows:

NCP = OCP *
CSO + CSP
CSO + CSAP

where:

NCP = new conversion price

OCP = old conversion price

CSO = common stock outstanding

CSP = common stock purchasable with consideration
received by company (i.e., what the buyer should
have bought if it hadn't been a down round issuance)

CSAP = common stock actually purchased in subsequent
issuance (i.e., what the buyer actually bought)

Note that despite the fact one is buying preferred stock, the cal-
culations are always done on an as-if-converted (to common stock)
basis. The company is not issuing more shares; rather, it determines
a new conversion price for the previous series of stock. Alterna-
tively, the company can issue more shares, but we think this is a silly
and unnecessarily complicated approach that merely increases the
amount the lawyers can bill the company for the financing. Con-
sequently, antidilution provisions usually generate a conversion price
adjustment.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="65" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Economic Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

You might note the term broad-based in describing weighted aver-
age anti-dilution. What makes the provision broad-based versus nar-
row-based is the definition of common stock outstanding (CSO). A
broad-based weighted average provision encompasses both the com-
pany's common stock outstanding (including all common stock issu-
able upon conversion of its preferred stock) as well as the number
of shares of common stock that could be obtained by converting all
other options, rights, and securities (including employee options).
A narrow-based provision will not include these other convertible
securities and will limit the calculation to only currently outstanding
securities. The number of shares and how you count them matter;
make sure you are agreeing on the same definition, as you'll often
find different lawyers arguing over what to include or not include in
the definitions.

In our example language, we've included a section that is gener-
ally referred to as "antidilution carve-outs"-the section "other than
shares (i) ... (iv)." These are the standard exceptions for shares
granted at lower prices for which anti-dilution does not apply. From
a company and entrepreneur perspective, more exceptions are bet-
ter, and most investors will accept these carve-outs without much
argument.

One particular item to note is the last carve-out:

(iv) shares with respect to which the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Series A Preferred waive their antidilution rights.

This is a carve-out that started appearing recently, which we have
found to be very helpful in deals where a majority of the Series A
investors agree to further fund a company in a follow-on financing,
but the price will be lower than the original Series A. In this exam-
ple, several minority investors signaled they were not planning to
invest in the new round, as they would have preferred to sit back
and increase their ownership stake via the anti-dilution provision.
Having the larger investors (the majority of the class) step up and
vote to carve the financing out of the antidilution terms was a bonus
for the company common stockholders and employees, who would
have suffered the dilution of additional anti-dilution from investors
who were not continuing to participate in financing the company.
This approach encourages the minority investors to participate in
the round in order to protect themselves from dilution.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="66" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Occasionally, antidilution will be absent in a Series A term sheet.
Investors love precedent (e.g., the new investor says, "I want what
the last guy got, plus more"). In many cases, antidilution provisions
hurt Series A investors more than later investors if you assume the
Series A price is the low-water mark for the company. For instance,
if the Series A price is $1, the Series B price is $5, and the Series C
price is $3, then the Series B benefits from the antidilution provision
at the expense of the Series A. Our experience is that antidilution
is usually requested despite this, as Series B investors will most likely
always ask for it and, since they do, the Series A investors proactively
ask for it anyway.

In addition to economic impacts, antidilution provisions can
have control impacts. First, the existence of an antidilution provision
will motivate the company to issue new rounds of stock at higher
valuations because of the impact of antidilution protection on the
common stockholders. In some cases, a company may pass on taking
an additional investment at a lower valuation, although practically
speaking, this happens only when a company has other alternatives
to the financing. A recent phenomenon is to tie antidilution calcu-
lations to milestones the investors have set for the company, result-
ing in a conversion price adjustment in the case that the company
does not meet certain revenue, product development, or other busi-
ness milestones. In this situation, the antidilution adjustment occurs
automatically if the company does not meet its objectives, unless the
investor waives it after the fact. This creates a powerful incentive for
the company to accomplish its investor-determined goals. We tend to
avoid this approach, as blindly hitting predetermined product and
sales milestones set at the time of a financing is not always best for
the long-term development of a company, especially if these goals
end up creating a diverging set of objectives between management
and the investors as the business evolves.

Antidilution provisions are almost always part of a financing, so
understanding the nuances and knowing which aspects to negotiate
are an important part of the entrepreneur's tool kit. We advise you
not to get hung up in trying to eliminate antidilution provisions.
Instead, focus on minimizing their impact and building value in
your company after the financing so they don't ever come into play.

# Control Terms of the Term Sheet

T.

he terms we discussed in the preceding chapter define the eco-
nomics of a deal; the next batch of terms define the control parame-
ters of a deal. Venture capitalists (VCs) care about control provisions
in order to keep an eye on their investments as well as comply with
certain federal tax statutes that are a result of the types of investors
that invest in VC funds. Some control provisions are necessary to
prevent VCs from running afoul of the fiduciary duties they owe to
both their investors and the companies they invest in. While VCs
often have less than 50% ownership of a company, they usually have
a variety of control terms that effectively give them control of many
activities of the company.

In this chapter we discuss the following terms: board of directors,
protective provisions, drag-along rights, and conversion.


## Board of Directors

One of the key control mechanisms is the process for electing the
board of directors. The entrepreneur should think carefully about
what the proper balance should be among investor, company,
founder, and outside representation on the board.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Electing a board of directors is an important, and delicate, point. Your board is
your inner sanctum, your strategic planning department, and your judge, jury,
and executioner all at once. Some VCs are terrible board members, even if
they're good investors and nice people.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="67" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="68" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

A typical board of directors clause follows:

Board of Directors: The size of the Company's Board of Direc-
tors shall be set at [X]. The Board shall initially be comprised
,
☒
of
as the Investor representative [s]
,

, and
. At each meeting for the election
of directors, the holders of the Series A Preferred, voting as a
separate class, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s] of the
☒
Company's Board of Directors which director shall be designated
by Investor, the holders of Common Stock, voting as a separate
class, shall be entitled to elect [X] member[s], and the remaining
☒
directors will be [Option 1: mutually agreed upon by the Com-
mon and Preferred, voting together as a single class] [or Option
2: chosen by the mutual consent of the Board of Directors].

If a subset of the board is being chosen by more than one constit-
uency (e.g., two directors chosen by the investors, two by founders
or common stockholders, and one by mutual consent), you should
consider what is best: chosen by mutual consent of the board (one
person, one vote) or voted upon on the basis of proportional share
ownership on a common-as-converted basis.

VCs will often want to include a board observer as part of the
agreement either instead of or in addition to an official member of
the board. The value of this will depend on who the observer is. With
many VC firms, the observer will be an associate in the firm. In these
cases, some will be just there to learn (and in the worst cases talk about
board topics to their friends over beers in order to look cool and
important), while others are immensely helpful. You'll even run into
observers who are more helpful than the VC partner on your board.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Be wary of observers. Sometimes they add no value yet they do take up seats at
the table. Often, it's not about who votes at a board meeting, but the discussion
that occurs, so observers can sway the balance of a board. You don't want to
find yourself with a pre-revenue company and 15 people around the table at a
board meeting.

Many investors will mandate that one of the board members
chosen by common stockholders be the then-serving CEO of the

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="69" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

company. This can be tricky if the CEO is the same as one of the
key founders (often you'll see language giving the right to a board
seat to one of the founders and a separate board seat to the then
CEO), consuming two of the common board seats. Then, if the CEO
changes, so does that board seat.

Let's go through two examples: an early-stage board for a
company that has raised its first round of capital and the board
of a company that is mature and contemplating an initial public
offering (IPO).

In the case of the early-stage board, there will often be three to
five board members:

The three-person board will typically consist of:

1\. Founder/CEO

2\. VC

3\. An outside board member, or perhaps another founder

The five-person board will typically consist of:

1\. Founder

2\. CEO

3\. VC

4\. A second VC

5\. An outside board member

These are the default cases for a balanced board that gives the
VC enough influence to be comfortable without having control over
the board. Correspondingly, the founder(s) and CEO will have the
same number of seats as the VCs, and the outside board member will
be able to help resolve any conflicts that arise as well as be a legiti-
mately independent board member.

In the case of a mature board, you'll typically see more board
members (seven to nine) with more outside board members. The
CEO and one of the founders are on this board along with a few of
the VCs (depending on the amount of money raised). However, the
majority of the additions to the board are outside board members,
typically experienced entrepreneurs or executives in the domain in
which the company is operating.

While it is appropriate for board members and observers to be
reimbursed for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs for attending

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="70 Venture Deals" -->

board meetings, we rarely see board members receive cash com-
pensation for serving on the board of a private company. Outside
board members are usually compensated with stock options-just
like key employees-and are often invited to invest money in the
company alongside the VCs. Usually you see these outsiders receive
options to purchase 0.25% to 0.5% of the company that vest over
two to four years.

We are of the opinion that VCs don't want to control boards of
portfolio companies. If the board votes are really that contentious
then the company is in serious trouble. Instead of controlling the
board, VCs generally use protective provisions, which we will discuss in
the next section, to provide the control they want over the company.

We are also of the opinion that the founders are better off not
controlling the board, either. Having an outside board member can
be invaluable for certain corporate governance issues that one will
want an impartial vote for. Also, having a true outside board member
will bring diversity of thought that most insiders (including both the
common and preferred holders) won't bring to the board room.

directors work, and more importantly how to make them useful, get

Boards: Getting the Most Out of Your Board of Directors.


### Protective Provisions

The next key control term you will encounter in the term sheet is
protective provisions. Protective provisions are effectively veto rights
that investors have on certain actions by the company. Not surpris-
ingly, these provisions protect VCs, although unfortunately not from
themselves.

Once upon a time, the protective provisions were often hotly
negotiated but over time have mostly become standardized. Entre-
preneurs would like to see few or no protective provisions in their
documents. In contrast, VCs would like to have some veto-level con-
trol over a set of actions the company could take, especially when it
impacts the VCs' economic position.

A typical protective provision clause looks as follows:

For so long as any shares of Series A Preferred remain outstand-
ing, consent of the Required Percentage of the Series A Preferred
shall be required for any action, whether directly or though

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="71" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

any merger, recapitalization or similar event, that (i) alters or
changes the rights, preferences or privileges of the Series A
Preferred, (ii) increases or decreases the authorized number of
shares of Common or Preferred Stock, (iii) creates (by reclas-
sification or otherwise) any new class or series of shares having
rights, preferences or privileges senior to or on a parity with the
Series A Preferred, (iv) results in the redemption or repurchase
of any shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to equity
incentive agreements with service providers giving the Company
the right to repurchase shares upon the termination of services),
(v) results in any merger, other corporate reorganization, sale of
control, or any transaction in which all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company are sold, (vi) amends or waives any provi-
sion of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws,
(vii) increases or decreases the authorized size of the Company's
Board of Directors, (viii) results in the payment or declaration
of any dividend on any shares of Common Preferred Stock,
(ix) issues debt in excess of $100,000, (x) makes any voluntary
petition for bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of credi-
tors, or (xi) enters into any exclusive license, lease, sale, distribu-
tion or other disposition of its products or intellectual property.

Let's translate this into what the VC is trying to protect against.
Simply, unless the VC agrees, the company can't:

· Change the terms of stock owned by the VC;

· Authorize the creation of more stock;

· Issue stock senior or equal to the VCs;

· Buy back any common stock;

· Sell the company;

· Change the certificate of incorporation or bylaws;

· Change the size of board of directors.

· Pay or declare a dividend;

· Borrow money;

· Declare bankruptcy without the VCs approval; or

· License away the IP of the company, effectively selling the
company without the VCs consent.

Subsection (ix) of the protective provision clause is often the first
thing that gets changed by raising the debt threshold to something

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="72" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

higher, as long as the company is a real operating business rather
than an early-stage startup. Another easily accepted change is to add
a minimum threshold of preferred shares outstanding for the pro-
tective provisions to apply, keeping the protective provisions from
lingering on forever when the capital structure is changed-through
either a positive or a negative event.

Many company counsels will ask for materiality qualifiers-for
instance, that the word material or materially be inserted in front of
subsections (i), (ii), and (vi) in the example. We always decline this
request, not to be stubborn, but because we don't really know what
material means (if you ask a judge or read any case law, that will not
help you, either), and we believe that specificity is more important
than debating reasonableness. Remember that these are protective
provisions; they don't eliminate the ability to do these things, but
simply require consent of the investors. As long as things are not
material from the VC's point of view, the consent to do these things
will be granted. We'd always rather be clear up front what the rules
of engagement are rather than have a debate over what the word
material means in the middle of a situation where these protective
provisions might come into play. Finally, there have been several
legal cases in the last decade that have all gone against VCs for not
drafting language that is specific.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As far as the example protective provision clause is concerned, (i) fair is fair;
(ii) fair is fair; (iii) fair is fair; (iv) this should be positive for VCs, but not a
big deal; (v) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in
aggregate, enough of your capitalization table to be relevant; (vi) makes sense;
(vii) this is critical as long as Series A preferred holders represent, in aggregate,
enough of your cap table to be relevant; (viii) you will never have to worry about
this; (ix) this is fine, though you should try to get a higher limit or an exclusion
for equipment financing in the normal course of business; (x) and (xi) are fine.

When future financing rounds occur (e.g., Series B, a new class
of preferred stock), there is always a discussion as to how the protec-
tive provisions will work with regard to the new class. There are two
cases: the Series B gets its own protective provisions or the Series B
investors vote alongside the original investors as a single class. Entre-
preneurs almost always will want a single vote for all the investors, as

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="73" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

the separate investor class protective provision vote means the com-
pany now has two classes of potential veto constituents to deal with.
Normally, new investors will ask for a separate vote, as their interests
may diverge from those of the original investors due to different
pricing, different risk profiles, and a false need for overall control.
However, many experienced investors will align with the entrepre-
neur's point of view of not wanting separate class votes, as they do
not want the potential headaches of another equity class vetoing
an important company action. If Series B investors are the same as
Series A investors, this is an irrelevant discussion and it should be
easy for everyone to default to voting as a single class. If you have
new investors in the Series B, be wary of inappropriate veto rights
for small investors; for example, the consent percentage required
is 90% instead of a majority (50.1%), enabling a new investor who
owns only 10.1 percent of the financing to effectively assert control
over the protective provisions through his vote.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Regardless of who your investors are, fight to have them vote as a single class.
It's critical for your sanity. It keeps investors aligned. And as long as your capi-
talization table is rational, it won't matter.

Some investors feel they have enough control with their board
involvement to ensure that the company does not take any action
contrary to their interests, and as a result will not focus on these
protective provisions. During a financing this is the typical argu-
ment used by company counsel to try to convince the VCs to back
off of some or all of the protective provisions. We think this is a
shortsighted approach for the investor, since, as a board member, an
investor designee has legal duties (tirelessly referred to in moments
of conflict as a fiduciary duty) to work in the best interests of the com-
pany. At the same time, VCs also have a fiduciary duty to their inves-
tors as well. Sometimes the interests of the company and a particular
class of shareholders diverge. Therefore, there can be times when
an individual would legally have to approve something as a board
member in the best interests of the company as a whole and not
have a protective provision to fall back on as a shareholder. While
this dynamic does not necessarily benefit the entrepreneur, it's good

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="74" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

governance as it functionally separates the duties of a board member
from those of a shareholder, shining a brighter light on an area of
potential conflict.

While one could make the argument that protective provisions
are at the core of the trust between a VC and an entrepreneur, we
think that's a hollow and naive statement. When an entrepreneur
asks, "Don't you trust me? Why do we need these things?" the simple
answer is that it is not an issue of trust. Rather, we like to eliminate the
discussion about who ultimately gets to make which decisions before
we do a deal. Eliminating the ambiguity in roles, control, and rules
of engagement is an important part of any financing, and the protec-
tive provisions cut to the heart of this. As discussed in Chapter 15,
all of this legal activity is an attempt to clarify the rules of engagement
and align incentives between investors and entrepreneurs.

Occasionally the protective provisions can help the entrepre-
neur, especially in an acquisition scenario. Since the investor can
effectively block a sale of the company, this provides the entrepre-
neur with some additional leverage when negotiating with the buyer
since the price needs to be high enough to garner the VC's consent
on the deal. Of course, this assumes a reasonable position from the
existing investor, but in most cases an experienced VC will support
the entrepreneur's decision to sell a company.

A decade ago the protective provisions took several days to nego-
tiate. Over time these provisions have been hotly tested in courts
of law from several important judicial decisions, so today they have
become mostly boilerplate with the only extended negotiation often
being around the word materiality.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Remember, you are negotiating this deal on behalf of the company (no matter
who runs it in the future) and with the investors (no matter who owns the shares
in the future). These terms are not only about your current relationship with the
VC in question.


## Drag-Along Agreement

Another important control provision is the drag-along agreement.
Under certain circumstances, the company will not want a specific
shareholder to vote his shares in whatever way the shareholder wants,

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="75" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

but instead prefers to have the shares voted by a certain investor or
class of investors. Unless a shareholder is on the board, she gener-
ally doesn't have a legal duty to keep the company's best interests
in mind.

There are two general flavors of drag-along agreements. The
first is where the preferred investors drag-along the common share-
holders. This agreement gives the preferred investors the ability to
force, or drag along, all of the other investors and the founders to
do a sale of the company, regardless of how the folks being dragged
along feel about the deal.

Typical language follows:

Drag-Along Agreement: The [holders of the Common Stock] or
[Founders] and Series A Preferred shall enter into a drag-along
agreement whereby if a majority of the holders of Series A Pre-
ferred agree to a sale or liquidation of the Company, the holders
of the remaining Series A Preferred and Common Stock shall
consent to and raise no objections to such sale.

After the Internet bubble burst of the early 2000s and sales
of companies started occurring that were at or below the liquida-
tion preferences, entrepreneurs and founders-not surprisingly-
started to resist selling the company in these situations since they
often weren't getting anything in the deal. While there are several
mechanisms to address sharing consideration below the liquidation
preferences, such as the notion of a carve-out, which we'll discuss
later, the fundamental issue is that if a transaction occurs below the
liquidation preferences, it's likely that some or all of the VCs are los-
ing money on the transaction. The VC point of view on this varies
widely and is often dependent on the situation; some VCs can deal
with this and are happy to provide some consideration to manage-
ment to get a deal done, whereas others are stubborn in their view
that since they lost money, management and founders shouldn't
receive anything.

In each of these situations, the VCs would much rather control
their ability to compel other shareholders to support the transac-
tion. As more of these situations appeared, the major holders of
common stock (even when they were in the minority of ownership)
began refusing to vote for the proposed transaction unless the hold-
ers of preferred stock waived part of their liquidation preferences in

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="76" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

favor of the common stock. Needless to say, this particular holdout
technique did not go over well in the venture community and, as a
result, the drag-along agreement became more prevalent.

More recently, a second flavor of drag-along has come to exist
and it is one that we prefer. In this version, if a founder leaves the
company, their stock will be dragged along by all other classes of
stock. In other words, a departed founder (who may or may not har-
bor ill will toward the company) cannot play the hold out on voting
matters. Typical language looks like this:

Drag-Along Agreement: When a Founder leaves the Company,
such Founder shall agree to vote his Common Stock or Series A
Preferred (or Common Stock acquired on conversion of Series
A or Former Series A Preferred) in the same proportion as all
other shares are voted in any vote.

Note that the dragged along shares are voted in proportion to
all the other votes cast. So if the vote is 90% yes and 10% no, the
departed founder's shares will be voted in a 90/10 split.

If you are faced with a drag-along situation, your ownership posi-
tion will determine whether or not this is an important issue for you.
An acquisition does not require unanimous consent of shareholders;
these rules vary by jurisdiction, although the two most common situ-
ations are either majority of each class (California) or majority of all
shares on an as-converted basis (Delaware). However, most acquirers
will want 85% to 90% of shareholders to consent to a transaction. If
you own one percent of a company and the VCs would like you to
sign up to a drag-along agreement, it doesn't matter much unless
there are 30 of you who each own one percent. Make sure you know
what you are fighting for in the negotiation, and don't put dispro-
portionate energy against terms that don't matter.

When a company is faced with the first flavor of a drag-along
agreement in a VC financing proposal, the most common compro-
mise position is to try to get the drag-along rights to pertain to follow-
ing the majority of the common stock, not the preferred. This way, if
you own common stock, you are dragged along only when a majority
of the common stockholders consent to the transaction. This is a
graceful position for a very small investor to take (e.g., "I'll play ball
if a majority of the common plays ball") and one that we've always
been willing to take when we've owned common stock in a company
(e.g., "I'm not going to stand in the way of something a majority of

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="77" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

folks who have rights equal to me want to do"). Of course, preferred
investors can always convert some of their holdings to common stock
to generate a majority, but this also results in a benefit to the com-
mon stockholders as it lowers the overall liquidation preference.

During the term sheet negotiation, pay attention to what your
lawyer might be saying to your investor during the negotiation of
a drag-along. We've seen many lawyers slam their fists on the table
rejecting any notion of a drag-along. While we clearly understand
the argument why a drag-along might not be in the best interests of
an individual, it's hard for us to see how this is not in the best inter-
ests of the company. In that instance we being to wonder whether
the lawyer is representing the company-who they should be rep-
resenting-or the founder(s). While nuanced, the dynamic can be
profoundly important, especially when there is conflict between a
founder and the company.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

This is one of those terms that matter most if things are falling apart, in which
case you probably have bigger fish to fry. And it cuts both ways-if you have a lot
of investors, for example, this term can force them all to agree to a deal, which
might save you from a lot of agitation down the road. Of course, it is best to not
be in a fire sale situation, or at least to have enough board members whom you
control (at least effectively, if not contractually) so that you can prevent a bad
deal from happening in the first place.


## Conversion

While many VCs posture during term sheet negotiations by saying
things like "That is nonnegotiable," terms rarely are. Occasionally,
though, a term will actually be nonnegotiable, and conversion is one
such term.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Amen. "This is nonnegotiable" is usually a phrase thrown out by junior mem-
bers of VC firms when they don't know any better. In particular, watch out for
the "This is how we always do deals" or "This is a standard deal term for us"
negotiating tactic as being ultra-lame and a sign that the people you're negotiat-
ing with don't really know what they are doing.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="78" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

In all the VC deals we've ever seen, the preferred shareholders
have the right-at any time-to convert their stake into common
stock. Following is the standard language:

Conversion: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall have the
right to convert the Series A Preferred, at any time, into shares
of Common Stock. The initial conversion rate shall be 1:1, sub-
ject to adjustment as provided below.

As we discussed in the liquidation preferences section, this allows
the buyers of preferred to convert to common should they deter-
mine on a liquidation that they would be better off getting paid on
an as-converted common basis rather than accepting the liquidation
preference and the participation amount. It can also be used in cer-
tain extreme circumstances whereby the preferred wants to control
a vote of the common on a certain issue. Note, however, that once
converted, there is no provision for reconverting back to preferred.

A more interesting term is the automatic conversion, especially
since it has several components that are negotiable.

Automatic Conversion: All of the Series A Preferred shall be
automatically converted into Common Stock, at the then appli-
cable conversion price, upon the closing of a firmly underwrit-
ten public offering of shares of Common Stock of the Company
at a per share price not less than [three] times the Original Pur-
chase Price (as adjusted for stock splits, dividends, and the like)
per share and for a total offering of not less than [$15] million
(before deduction of underwriters' commissions and expenses)
(a "Qualified IPO"). All, or a portion of each share, of the Series
A Preferred shall be automatically converted into Common
Stock, at the then applicable conversion price in the event that
the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Series A Pre-
ferred consent to such conversion.

In an IPO of a venture-backed company, the investment bank-
ers will almost always want to see everyone convert into common
stock at the time of the IPO. It is rare for a venture-backed company
to go public with multiple classes of stock, although occasionally
you will see dual classes of shares in an IPO as Google had. The
thresholds for the automatic conversion are critical to negotiate. As

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="79" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Control Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

the entrepreneur you want them lower to ensure more flexibility,
whereas your investors will want them higher to give them more
control over the timing and terms of an IPO.

Regardless of the actual thresholds, it's important to never allow
investors to negotiate different automatic conversion terms for dif-
ferent series of preferred stock. There are many horror stories of
companies on the brink of going public with one class of preferred
stockholders having a threshold above what the proposed offering
would result in; as a result, these stockholders have an effective veto
right on the offering.

For example, assume that you have an early-stage investor with
an automatic conversion threshold of $30 million and a later-stage
investor with an automatic conversion threshold of $60 million. Now,
assume you are at the goal line for an IPO and it's turning out to be
a $50 million offering based on the market and the demand for your
company. Your early investor is ready to go, but your later-stage inves-
tor suddenly says, "I'd like a little something else since I can block
the deal and even though you've done all of this work to get to an
IPO, I don't think I can support it unless .. . " In these cases, much
last-minute legal and financial wrangling ensues given the lack of
alignment between your different classes of investors. To avoid this,
we strongly recommend that you equalize the automatic conversion
threshold among all series of stock at each financing.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Understand what the norms are for new IPOs before you dig your heels in on
conversion terms. There's no reason to negotiate away other more critical terms
over a $20 million threshold versus a $30 million threshold if the norm is $50
million. Besides, a board decision to pursue an IPO will put pressure on a VC to
waive this provision.

## CHAPTER


## Other Terms of the Term Sheet

U
p to this point we've been exploring terms that matter a lot and
fall under the category of economics or control. As we get further
into the term sheet, we start to encounter some terms that don't
matter as much, are only impactful in a downside scenario, or don't
matter at all.

This chapter covers those terms, which include dividends,
redemption rights, conditions precedent to financing, information
rights, registration rights, right of first refusal, voting rights, restric-
tion on sales, proprietary information and inventions agreement,
co-sale agreement, founders' activities, initial public offering shares
purchase, no-shop agreement, indemnification, and assignment.


### Dividends

Whereas private equity investors love dividends, most venture capi-
talists, especially early-stage ones, don't really care about them. In
our experience, the venture capitalists (VCs) who do care about divi-
dends either come from a private equity background or are focused
on downside protection in larger deals.

Typical dividend language in a term sheet follows:

Dividends: The holders of the Series A Preferred shall be enti-
tled to receive [non]cumulative dividends in preference to any
dividend on the Common Stock at the rate of [8%] of the Origi-
nal Purchase Price per annum [when and as declared by the
Board of Directors]. The holders of Series A Preferred also shall

<!-- PageNumber="81" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="82" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

be entitled to participate pro rata in any dividends paid on the
Common Stock on an as-if-converted basis.

For early-stage investments, dividends generally do not provide
venture returns-they are simply additional juice in a deal. Let's do
some simple math. Assume a typical dividend of 10% (dividends will
range from 5 to 15% depending on how aggressive your investor is;
we picked 10% to make the math easy).

Now, assume that the VC has negotiated hard and gotten a 10%
cumulative annual dividend. In this case, the VC automatically gets
the dividend every year. To keep the math simple, let's assume the
dividend does not compound. As a result, each year the VC gets 10%
of the investment as a dividend. Assume a home run deal such as
a 50x return on a $10 million investment in five years. Even with a
10% cumulative annual dividend, this increases the VC's return from
$500 million to only $505 million (the annual dividend is $1 million,
or 10% of $10 million, times five years).

While the extra money from the dividend is nice, it doesn't really
impact the success case. Since venture funds typically have a 10-year
life, the dividend generates another 1x return only if you invest on
day one of a fund and hold the investment for 10 years.

This also assumes the company can actually pay out the dividend.
Usually the dividends can be paid in either stock or cash, typically at
the option of the company. Obviously, the dividend could drive addi-
tional dilution if it is paid out in stock, so this is the one case in which
it is important not to get head-faked by the investor, where the divi-
dend becomes another form of anti-dilution protection-one that is
automatic and simply linked to the passage of time.

We are being optimistic about the return scenarios. In down-
side cases, the dividend can matter, especially as the invested capital
increases. For example, take a $40 million investment with a 10%
annual cumulative dividend in a company that was sold at the end
of the fifth year to another company for $80 million. In this case,
assume that there was a simple liquidation preference with no par-
ticipation and the investor got 40% of the company for his invest-
ment (at a $100 million post-money valuation). Since the sale price
was below the investment post-money valuation (i.e., a loser, but not
a disaster), the investor will exercise the liquidation preference and
take the $40 million plus the dividend ($4 million per year for five
years, or $20 million). In this case, the difference between the return

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="83" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

in a no-dividend scenario ($40 million) and a dividend scenario
($60 million) is material.

Mathematically, the larger the investment amount and the lower
the expected exit multiple, the more the dividend matters. This is
why you see dividends in private equity and buyout deals where large
investments are involved (typically greater than $50 million) and the
expectation for return multiples on invested capital is lower.

Automatic dividends have some nasty side effects, especially if the
company runs into trouble, since they typically should be included
in the solvency analysis. If you aren't paying attention, an automatic
cumulative dividend can put you unknowingly into the zone of insol-
vency, which is a bad place to be. Cumulative dividends can also be
an accounting nightmare, especially when they are optionally paid
in stock, cash, or a conversion adjustment, but that's why the accoun-
tants get paid the big bucks at the end of the year to put together the
audited balance sheet.

That said, the noncumulative dividend when declared by the
board is benign, rarely declared, and an artifact of the past, so
we typically leave it in term sheets just to give the lawyers some-
thing to do.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

The thing to care about here is ensuring that dividends have to be approved by
a majority-or even a supermajority-of your board of directors.


## Redemption Rights

Even though redemption rights rarely come into play, some VCs
are often overly focused on them in the deal because they provide
additional downside protection. A typical redemption rights clause
follows:

Redemption at Option of Investors: At the election of the hold-
ers of at least a majority of the Series A Preferred, the Company
shall redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred in three annual
installments beginning on the [fifth] anniversary of the Closing.
Such redemptions shall be at a purchase price equal to the Orig-
inal Purchase Price plus declared and unpaid dividends.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="84 Venture Deals" -->

There is some rationale for redemption rights. First, there is
the fear (on the VC's part) that a company will become successful
enough to be an ongoing business but not quite successful enough
to go public or be acquired. In this case, redemption rights were
invented to allow the investor a guaranteed exit path. However, a
company that is around for a while as a going concern while not
being an attractive initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition can-
didate generally won't have the cash to pay out redemption rights.

Another reason for redemption rights pertains to the life span
of venture funds. The average venture fund has a 10-year life span
to conduct its business. If a VC makes an investment in year five of
the fund, it might be important for that fund manager to secure
redemption rights in order to have a liquidity path before the fund
must wind down. As with the previous case, whether or not the com-
pany has the ability to pay is another matter.

Often, companies will claim that redemption rights create lia-
bilities on their balance sheets and can make certain business optics
more difficult. By optics, we mean how certain third-parties view
the health and stability of the company such as bankers, custom-
ers, and employees. In the past few years, accountants have begun
to argue more strongly that redeemable preferred stock is a liabil-
ity on the balance sheet instead of an equity feature. Unless the
redeemable preferred stock is mandatorily redeemable, this is not
the case, and most experienced accountants will be able to recog-
nize the difference.

There is one form of redemption that we have seen in the past
few years that we view as overreaching-the adverse change redemp-
tion. We recommend you never agree to the following term that has
recently crept into term sheets:

Adverse Change Redemption: Should the Company experience
a material adverse change to its prospects, business, or financial
position, the holders of at least a majority of the Series A Pre-
ferred shall have the option to commit the Company to immedi-
ately redeem the outstanding Series A Preferred. Such redemp-
tion shall be at a purchase price equal to the Original Purchase
Price plus declared and unpaid dividends.

This term effectively gives the VC a right to a redemption in the
case of a "material adverse change to its . . . business." The problem

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="85" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

is that "material adverse change" is not defined, is a vague concept,
is too punitive, and shifts an inappropriate amount of control to
the investors based on an arbitrary judgment of the investors. If this
term is being proposed and you are getting resistance on eliminat-
ing it, make sure you are speaking to a professional investor and not
a loan shark.

In our experience, redemption rights are well understood by
VCs and should not create a problem, except in a theoretical argu-
ment between lawyers and accountants.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

I don't worry about redemption rights much, although the adverse change
redemption clause is evil. As with dividends, just make sure you have maxi-
mum protection around your board, or all classes of preferred shareholders
voting in aggregate, and not just the majority of a random class of shareholder
declaring these.


### Conditions Precedent to Financing

While there is a lot to negotiate, a term sheet is simply a step on
the way to an actual deal. Term sheets are often nonbinding (or
mostly nonbinding) and most VCs will load them up with conditions
precedent to financing. Entrepreneurs glance over these, usually
because they are in the back sections of the term sheet and seem
pretty innocuous, but they occasionally have additional ways out of a
deal for the investor that the entrepreneur should watch for, if only
to better understand the current mindset of the investor proposing
the investment.

A typical conditions precedent to financing clause looks like this:

Conditions Precedent to Financing: Except for the provisions
contained herein entitled "Legal Fees and Expenses," "No-Shop
Agreement," and "Governing Law," which are explicitly agreed
by the Investors and the Company to be binding upon execu-
tion of this term sheet, this summary of terms is not intended
as a legally binding commitment by the Investors, and any obli-
gation on the part of the Investors is subject to the following
conditions precedent: 1. Completion of legal documentation

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="86" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

satisfactory to the prospective Investors; 2. Satisfactory comple-
tion of due diligence by the prospective Investors; 3. Delivery of a
customary management rights letter to Investors; and 4. Submis-
sion of a detailed budget for the following twelve (12) months,
acceptable to Investors.

Note that the investors will try to make a few things binding-
specifically that legal fees get paid whether or not a deal happens,
the company can't shop the deal once the term sheet is signed, or
the governing law be set to a specific domicile-while explicitly stat-
ing that a bunch of things still have to happen before this deal is
done, and they can back out for any reason.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Try to avoid conditions precedent to financing as much as possible. Again, the
best Plan A has the strongest Plan B standing behind it. Your prospective VC
should be willing to move quickly and snap up your deal on acceptable terms
by the time the VC gets to a term sheet. At a minimum, do not agree to pay for
the VC's legal fees unless the deal is completed (with a possible carve-out for
you canceling the deal).

There are three conditions to watch out for since they usually
signal something nonobvious on the part of the VC. They are:

1\. Approval by investors' partnerships. This is secret VC code for
"This deal has not been approved by the investors who issued
this term sheet." Therefore, even if you love the terms of
the deal, you still may not have a deal. Note that we've seen
cases where this isn't explicitly put in the term sheet but is
still the case. When signing a term sheet, always ask your VC
whether the terms have been approved by the partnership
or if there is another approval step in the process. Be cau-
tious of agreeing to go forward exclusively with a VC in situ-
ations where you still have additional approval steps in their
partnership process.

2\. Rights offering to be completed by company. This indicates that the
VCs want to offer all previous investors in the company the
ability to participate in the currently contemplated financ-
ing. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as in most cases it

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="87" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

serves to protect all parties from liability, but it does add time
and expense to the deal.

3\. Employment agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors.
Be aware of what the full terms are before signing the agree-
ment. As an entrepreneur, when faced with this, it's probably
wise to understand and negotiate the form of employment
agreement early in the process. You'll want to try to do this
before you sign a term sheet and accept a no-shop clause,
but most VCs will wave you off and say, "Don't worry about
it-we'll come up with something that works for everyone."
Make sure you understand the key terms such as compensa-
tion and what happens if you get fired.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Insist on spelling out key terms prior to a signed term sheet if it has a no-shop
clause in it. A VC who won't spell out key employment terms at the beginning
is a big red flag.

There are plenty of other wacky conditions-if you can dream it
up, it has probably been done. Just make sure to look carefully at this
paragraph and remember that you don't necessarily have a deal just
because you've signed a term sheet.


## Information Rights

We are back to another ubiquitous term that is important to the VC
but shouldn't matter much to the entrepreneur. Information rights
define the type of information the VC legally has access to and the
time frame in which the company is required to deliver it to the VC.

Information Rights: So long as an Investor continues to hold
[any] shares of Series A Preferred or Common Stock issued
upon conversion of the Series A Preferred, the Company shall
deliver to the Investor the Company's annual budget, as well as
audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements.
Furthermore, as soon as reasonably possible, the Company shall
furnish a report to each Investor comparing each annual budget
to such financial statements. Each Investor shall also be entitled

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="88" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

to standard inspection and visitation rights. These provisions
shall terminate upon a Qualified IPO.

You might ask, "If these terms rarely matter, why bother?" Since
you will end up having to deal with them in a VC term sheet, you
might as well be exposed to them and hear that they don't matter
much. Of course, from a VC perspective, "doesn't matter much" can
also mean "Mr. Entrepreneur, please don't pay much attention to
these terms-just accept them as is." However, our view is that if an
investor or the company is hotly negotiating this particular term,
that time (and lawyer money) is most likely being wasted.

Information rights are generally something companies are stuck
with in order to get investment capital. The only variation one sees
is a threshold on the number of shares held (some finite number
versus "any") for investors to continue to enjoy these rights.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If you care about information rights for your shareholders, you are nuts. You
should run a transparent organization as much as possible in the twenty-first
century. If you can't commit to sending your shareholders a budget and financial
statements, you shouldn't take on outside investors. If you are of the paranoid
mindset (which I generally applaud), feel free to insist on a strict confidentiality
clause to accompany your information rights.


## Registration Rights

Registration rights define the rights that investors have to registering
their shares in an IPO scenario as well as the obligation of the com-
pany to the VCs whenever they file additional registration statements
after the IPO. This is a tedious example of something that rarely
matters, yet tends to take up a page or more of the term sheet. Get
ready for your mind to be numbed.

Registration Rights: Demand Rights: If Investors holding more
than 50% of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, includ-
ing Common Stock issued on conversion of Series A Preferred
("Registrable Securities"), or a lesser percentage if the antici-
pated aggregate offering price to the public is not less than

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="89" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

$5 million, request that the Company file a Registration State-
ment, the Company will use its best efforts to cause such shares to
be registered; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to effect any such registration prior to the [third] anni-
versary of the Closing. The Company shall have the right to delay
such registration under certain circumstances for one period not
in excess of ninety (90) days in any twelve (12)-month period.

The Company shall not be obligated to effect more than two
(2) registrations under these demand right provisions, and shall
not be obligated to effect a registration (i) during the one hun-
dred eighty (180)-day period commencing with the date of the
Company's initial public offering, or (ii) if it delivers notice to
the holders of the Registrable Securities within thirty (30) days
of any registration request of its intent to file a registration state-
ment for such initial public offering within ninety (90) days.

Company Registration: The Investors shall be entitled to "piggy-
back" registration rights on all registrations of the Company or
on any demand registrations of any other investor subject to the
right, however, of the Company and its underwriters to reduce
the number of shares proposed to be registered pro rata in view
of market conditions. If the Investors are so limited, however, no
party shall sell shares in such registration other than the Com-
pany or the Investor, if any, invoking the demand registration.
Unless the registration is with respect to the Company's initial
public offering, in no event shall the shares to be sold by the
Investors be reduced below 30% of the total amount of securi-
ties included in the registration. No shareholder of the Com-
pany shall be granted piggyback registration rights which would
reduce the number of shares includable by the holders of the
Registrable Securities in such registration without the consent
of the holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities.

S-3 Rights: Investors shall be entitled to unlimited demand reg-
istrations on Form S-3 (if available to the Company) so long as
such registered offerings are not less than $1 million.

Expenses: The Company shall bear registration expenses
(exclusive of underwriting discounts and commissions) of all
such demands, piggybacks, and S-3 registrations (including the
expense of one special counsel of the selling shareholders not
to exceed $25,000).

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="90" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Transfer of Rights: The registration rights may be transferred to
(i) any partner, member, or retired partner or member or affili-
ated fund of any holder which is a partnership, (ii) any member
or former member of any holder which is a limited liability com-
pany, (iii) any family member or trust for the benefit of any indi-
vidual holder, or (iv) any transferee who satisfies the criteria to
be a Major Investor (as defined below); provided the Company
is given written notice thereof.

Lockup Provision: Each Investor agrees that it will not sell its
shares for a period to be specified by the managing underwriter
(but not to exceed 180 days) following the effective date of the
Company's initial public offering; provided that all officers,
directors, and other 1% shareholders are similarly bound. Such
lockup agreement shall provide that any discretionary waiver or
termination of the restrictions of such agreements by the Com-
pany or representatives of underwriters shall apply to Major
Investors, pro rata, based on the number of shares held.

Other Provisions: Other provisions shall be contained in the
Investor Rights Agreement with respect to registration rights as
are reasonable, including cross-indemnification, the period of
time in which the Registration Statement shall be kept effec-
tive, and underwriting arrangements. The Company shall not
require the opinion of Investor's counsel before authorizing the
transfer of stock or the removal of Rule 144 legends for routine
sales under Rule 144 or for distribution to partners or members
of Investors.

Registration rights are something the company will almost always
have to offer to investors. What is most interesting about registration
rights is that lawyers seem genetically incapable of leaving this sec-
tion untouched and always end up negotiating something. Perhaps
because this provision is so long, they feel the need to keep their pens
warm while reading. We find it humorous (as long as we aren't the
ones paying the legal fees) because, in the end, the modifications are
generally innocuous, and besides, if you ever get to the point where
registration rights come into play (e.g., an IPO), the investment bank-
ers of the company are going to have a major hand in deciding how
the deal is going to be structured, regardless of the contract the com-
pany entered into years before when it did an early-stage financing.

# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Don't focus much energy on registration rights. This is more about upside. The
world is good if you're going public.


## Right of First Refusal

The right of first refusal defines the rights that an investor has to buy
shares in a future financing. Right of first refusal is another chewy term
that takes up a lot of space in the term sheet but is hard for the entre-
preneur to have much impact on. Following is the typical language:

Right of First Refusal: Prior to a Qualified IPO, Major Investors
shall have the right to purchase their pro rata portions (calculated
on a fully diluted basis) of any future issuances of equity securi-
ties by the Company (with overallotment rights in the event a
Major Investor does not purchase its full allocation), other than
(i) shares or options to purchase shares issued to employees, con-
sultants or directors as approved by the Board, (ii) shares issued
for consideration other than cash pursuant to a merger, consoli-
dation, acquisition, or similar business combination approved by
the Board; (iii) shares issued pursuant to any equipment loan or
leasing arrangement, real property leasing arrangement or debt
financing from a bank or similar financial institution approved by
the Board; and (iv) other issuances approved by the Required Per-
centage of the outstanding Series A Preferred from time to time.

The right of first refusal is also known as a pro rata right. While
almost all VCs will insist on a right of first refusal, there are two things
to pay attention to in this term that can be negotiated. First, the share
threshold that defines a major investor can be defined. It's often conve-
nient, especially if you have a large number of small investors, not to
have to give this right to them. However, since in future rounds you are
typically interested in getting as much participation from your existing
investors as you can, it's not worth struggling with this too much.

A more important thing to watch for is a multiple on the pur-
chase rights (e.g., the "[X] times" listed). This is often referred to
as a super pro rata right and is an excessive ask, especially early in the
financing life cycle of a company.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="92" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

The right of first refusal is not a big deal, and in some cases it's good for you.
But make sure you define what a major investor is and give this only to them. At
a minimum, you can make sure that shareholders get this right only if they play
in subsequent rounds.


## Voting Rights

Voting rights define how the preferred stock and the common stock
relate to each other in the context of a share vote. It is another term
that doesn't matter that much. The typical language follows:

Voting Rights: The Series A Preferred will vote together with
the Common Stock and not as a separate class except as spe-
cifically provided herein or as otherwise required by law. The
Common Stock may be increased or decreased by the vote of
holders of a majority of the Common Stock and Series A Pre-
ferred voting together on an as-if-converted basis, and without
a separate class vote. Each share of Series A Preferred shall
have a number of votes equal to the number of shares of Com-
mon Stock then issuable upon conversion of such share of
Series A Preferred.

Most of the time the voting rights clause is simply an FYI section,
as all the important rights, such as the protective provisions, are con-
tained in other sections.


## Restriction on Sales

The restriction on sales clause, also known as the right of first refusal
on sales of common stock (or ROFR on common), defines the
parameters associated with selling shares of stock when the company
is a private company. Typical language follows:

Restrictions on Sales: The Company's Bylaws shall contain a
right of first refusal on all transfers of Common Stock, subject
to normal exceptions. If the Company elects not to exercise its
right, the Company shall assign its right to the Investors.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="93" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

Historically, founders and management rarely argue against this,
as it helps control the shareholder base of the company, which usu-
ally benefits all the existing shareholders (except possibly the ones
who want to bail out of their private stock). However, we've found
that the lawyers will often spend time arguing about how to imple-
ment this particular clause-specifically whether to include it in the
bylaws or include it in each of the company's option agreements,
plans, and stock sales. We find it easier to include this clause in the
bylaws since then it's in one place and is hard to overlook.

In the early days of venture capital (say, until 2007) there was
a strong conventional wisdom that founders and management
shouldn't be able to sell their shares until the investors could sell their
shares, through either an IPO or a sale of the company. As the time
to liquidity for private companies stretched out and IPOs became less
common, this philosophy shifted. Simultaneously, a healthy second-
ary market for founders and early employee shares appeared, fueled
both by the rapid rise in valuation of private companies such as Face-
book, Uber, Airbnb, and Twitter, along with the emergence of private
secondary markets such as Second Market and SharesPost. The result
is a lot more sales of private stock to other investors (sometimes new
ones, sometimes the existing investors) along with more scrutiny and
discussion around the ROFR on common construct.

After being involved in several situations where this has come
into play, we feel more strongly than ever that an ROFR on common
is a good thing for the company and should be supported by the
founders, management, and investors. Controlling the share owner-
ship in a private company is important, especially as the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) takes a closer look at various pri-
vate shareholder rules-both regarding ownership and stock sales.
The ROFR on common gives the company the ability to at least
know what is going on and make decisions in the context of the
various proposals.


### Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement

Every term sheet we've ever seen has a proprietary information and
inventions agreement clause. The typical language follows:

Proprietary Information and Inventions Agreement: Each current
and former officer, employee, and consultant of the Company

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="94 Venture Deals" -->

shall enter into an acceptable proprietary information and inven-
tions agreement.

This paragraph benefits both the company and investors and is
simply a mechanism that investors use to get the company to legally
stand behind the representation that it owns its intellectual prop-
erty (IP). Many pre-Series A companies have issues surrounding
this, especially if the company hasn't had great legal representation
prior to its first venture round. We've also run into plenty of situ-
ations (including several of ours-oops!) in which companies are
loose about this between financings, and while a financing is a good
time to clean this up, it's often annoying to previously hired employ-
ees who are now told, "Hey-you need to sign this since we need
it for the venture financing." It's even more important in the sale
of a company, as the buyer will always insist on clear ownership of
the IP. Our best advice here is that companies should build these
agreements into their hiring process from the very beginning (with
the advice from a good law firm) so that there are never any issues
around this, as VCs will always insist on this agreement.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

A proprietary information and inventions agreement clause is good for the com-
pany. You should have all employees, including founders, sign something like
this before you do an outside venture financing. If someone on the team needs
a specific carve-out for work in progress that is unrelated to the business, you
and your investors should be willing to grant it.


## Co-Sale Agreement

Most investors will insist on a co-sale agreement, which states that if
a founder sells shares, the investors will have an opportunity to sell a
proportional amount of their stock as well. Typical language follows:

Co-Sale Agreement: The shares of the Company's securities
held by the Founders shall be made subject to a co-sale agree-
ment (with certain reasonable exceptions) with the Investors
such that the Founders may not sell, transfer, or exchange their
stock unless each Investor has an opportunity to participate in

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="95" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

the sale on a pro rata basis. This right of co-sale shall not apply
to and shall terminate upon a Qualified IPO.

The chance of keeping this provision out of a financing is close
to zero, so we don't think it's worth fighting it. Notice that this mat-
ters only while the company is private-if the company goes public,
this clause no longer applies.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Your chances of eliminating the co-sale agreement clause may be zero, but
there's no reason not to ask for a floor to it. If you or your cofounders want to sell
a small amount of stock to buy a house, why should a VC hold it up? A right of
first refusal on the purchase with a bona fide outside offer's valuation as the pur-
chase price is one thing. An effective exclusion is something entirely different.


### Founders' Activities

As you wind your way through a typical term sheet, you'll often see,
buried near the back, a short clause concerning founders' activities.
It usually looks something like this:

Founders' Activities: Each of the Founders shall devote 100% of
his professional time to the Company. Any other professional
activities will require the approval of the Board of Directors.

It should be no surprise to a founder that your friendly neigh-
borhood VC wants you to be spending 100% (actually 120%) of
your professional time and attention on your company. If this para-
graph sneaks its way into the term sheet, the VC either has recently
been burned, is suspicious, or is concerned that one or more of the
founders may be working on something besides the company being
funded. Or in our case, we just put in it to see if anyone pushes back
on it. If someone does, it starts an interesting conversation.

Of course, this is a classic no-win situation for a founder. If you
are actually working on something else at the same time and don't
disclose it, you are violating the terms of the agreement in addition
to breaching trust before you get started. If you do disclose other
activities or push back on this clause (hence signaling that you are

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="96" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

working on something else), you'll reinforce the concern that the
VC has. So tread carefully here. Our recommendation, unless of
course you are working on something else, is simply to agree to this.

In situations where we've worked with a founder who already
has other obligations or commitments, we've always appreciated her
being up front with us early in the process. We've usually been able
to work through these situations in a way that results in everyone
being happy, and in the cases where we couldn't get there, were glad
that the issue came up early so that we didn't waste our time or the
entrepreneur's time.

While there are situations where VCs get comfortable with entre-
preneurs working on multiple companies simultaneously (usually
with very experienced entrepreneurs or in situations where the VC
and the entrepreneur have worked together in the past), they are a
rare exception, not the norm.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If you can't agree to a founders' activities clause, don't look for professional
VC financing. Or you can negotiate a very specific carve-out, and expect other
consequences in your terms (e.g., vesting and IP rights).


## Initial Public Offering Shares Purchase

One of the terms that falls into the "nice problem to have" category is
the initial public offering shares purchase. The typical language follows:

Initial Public Offering Shares Purchase: In the event that the
Company shall consummate a Qualified IPO, the Company shall
use its best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or under-
writers of such IPO to offer to [investors] the right to purchase
at least [5%] of any shares issued under a "friends and family"
or "directed shares" program in connection with such Qualified
IPO. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all action taken pursuant
to this Section shall be made in accordance with all federal and
state securities laws, including, without limitation, Rule 134 of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and all applicable rules and
regulations promulgated by the National Association of Securi-
ties Dealers, Inc. and other such self-regulating organizations.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="97" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

This term blossomed in the late 1990s when anything that was
VC funded was positioned as a company that would shortly go pub-
lic. However, most investment bankers will push back on this term
if the IPO is going to be a success, as they want to get stock into
the hands of institutional investors (their clients). If the VCs get this
push-back, they are usually so giddy with joy that the company is
going public that they don't argue with the bankers. Ironically, if
they don't get this push-back, or even worse, get a call near the end
of the IPO road show in which the bankers are asking them to buy
shares in the offering, they usually panic and do whatever they can
to not have to buy into the offering since this means the deal is no
longer a hot one.

Our recommendation on this one is don't worry about it or
spend lawyer time on it.


## No-Shop Agreement

As an entrepreneur, the way to get the best deal for a round of financ-
ing is to have multiple options. However, there comes a point in time
when you have to choose your investor and shift from "search for an
investor" mode to "close the deal" mode. Part of this involves choos-
ing your lead investor and negotiating the final term sheet with him.

A no-shop agreement is almost always part of this final term
sheet. Think of it as serial monogamy-your new investor-to-be
doesn't want you running around behind his back just as you are
about to get hitched. A typical no-shop agreement follows:

No-Shop Agreement: The Company agrees to work in good faith
expeditiously toward a closing. The Company and the Founders
agree that they will not, directly or indirectly, (i) take any action
to solicit, initiate, encourage, or assist the submission of any pro-
posal, negotiation, or offer from any person or entity other than
the Investors relating to the sale or issuance of any of the capital
stock of the Company or the acquisition, sale, lease, license, or
other disposition of the Company or any material part of the
stock or assets of the Company, or (ii) enter into any discussions
or negotiations or execute any agreement related to any of the
foregoing, and shall notify the Investors promptly of any inquir-
ies by any third parties in regard to the foregoing. Should both
parties agree that definitive documents shall not be executed

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="98" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

pursuant to this term sheet, then the Company shall have no
further obligations under this section.

At some level the no-shop agreement, like serial monogamy,
is more of an emotional commitment than a legal one. While it's
very hard, but not impossible, to enforce a no-shop agreement in a
financing, if you get caught cheating, your financing will probably
go the same way as the analogous situation when the groom or the
bride-to-be gets caught in a compromising situation.

The no-shop agreement reinforces the handshake that says,
"Okay, let's get a deal done-no more fooling around looking for a
better or different one." In all cases, the entrepreneur should bound
the no-shop agreement by a time period-usually 45 to 60 days is
plenty, although you can occasionally get a VC to agree to a 30-day
no-shop agreement. This makes the commitment bidirectional-you
agree not to shop the deal; the VC agrees to get things done within
a reasonable time frame.

Now, some entrepreneurs still view that as a unilateral agreement;
namely, the entrepreneur is agreeing to the no-shop but the VC isn't
really agreeing to anything at all. In most cases, we don't view the no-
shop clause as terribly important since it can be bounded with time.
Instead, we feel it's much more important for the entrepreneur to
test the VCs commitment to follow through on the investment when
signing up to do the deal.

Specifically, in some cases VCs put down term sheets early, well
before they've got internal agreement within their partnership to
do an investment. This used to be more common; today many early-
stage VCs don't want to go through the hassle of drafting the term
sheet and trying to negotiate it unless they believe they will do the
deal. In addition, there is a potential negative reputational impact
for the VC, as word will get around that VC X puts term sheets out
early, but then can't or won't close. In the age of the Internet, this
type of reputation spreads like an infectious disease.

Although we've done hundreds of investments, we've only seen
a few situations where the no-shop agreement had any meaning-
ful impact on a deal in which we were involved. When we thought
about the situations in which we were the VC and were negatively
impacted by not having a no-shop agreement (e.g., a company we
had agreed with on a term sheet went and did something else) or
where we were on the receiving end of a no-shop agreement and

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="99" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Other Terms of the Term Sheet" -->

were negatively impacted by it (e.g., an acquirer tied us up but then
ultimately didn't close on the deal), we actually didn't feel particu-
larly bad about any of the situations since there was both logic asso-
ciated with the outcome and grace exhibited by the participants.
Following are two examples:

We signed a term sheet to invest in Company X. We didn't
include a no-shop clause in the term sheet. We were working to
close the investment (we were 15 days into a 30-ish-day process) and
had legal documents going back and forth. One of the founders
called us and said that they had just received an offer to be acquired
and they wanted to pursue it. We told them no problem-we'd still
be there to do the deal if it didn't come together. We were very
open with them about the pros and cons of doing the deal from our
perspective and, given the economics, encouraged them to pursue
the acquisition offer (it was a great deal for them). They ended up
closing the deal and, as a token, gave us a small amount of equity
in the company for our efforts (totally unexpected and unnecessary
but appreciated).

In another situation we were already investors in a company that
was in the process of closing an outside-led round at a significant
step-up in valuation. The company was under a no-shop agreement
with the new VC. A week prior to closing, we received an acquisi-
tion overture from one of the strategic investors in the company.
We immediately told the new lead investor about it, who graciously
agreed to suspend the no-shop agreement and wait to see whether
we wanted to move forward with the acquisition or with the financ-
ing. We negotiated with the acquirer for several weeks, checking
regularly with the new potential investor to make sure they were
still interested in closing the round if we chose not to pursue the
acquisition. They were incredibly supportive and patient. The com-
pany covered its legal fees up to that point (unprompted-although
it was probably in the term sheet that we'd cover them; we can't
recall). We ended up moving forward with the acquisition; the new
investor was disappointed in the outcome but happy and supportive
of what we did.

While both of these are edge cases, in almost all of our experi-
ences the no-shop agreement ended up being irrelevant. As each of
these examples shows, the quality and the character of the people
involved made all the difference and were much more important
than the legal term.

# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As an entrepreneur, you should also ask that the no-shop clause expire imme-
diately if the VC terminates the process. Also, consider asking for a carve-
out for acquisitions. Frequently financings and acquisitions follow each other
around. Even if you're not looking to be acquired, you don't want handcuffs on
conversations about an acquisition just because a VC is negotiating with you
about a financing.


## Indemnification

The indemnification clause states that the company will indemnify
investors and board members to the maximum extent possible by law.
It is another one that entrepreneurs just have to live with. It follows:

Indemnification: The bylaws and/or other charter documents
of the Company shall limit board members' liability and expo-
sure to damages to the broadest extent permitted by applica-
ble law. The Company will indemnify board members and will
indemnify each Investor for any claims brought against the
Investors by any third party (including any other shareholder of
the Company) as a result of this financing.

Given all of the shareholder litigation in recent years, there is
almost no chance that a company will get funded without indemnify-
ing its directors. The first sentence is simply a contractual obligation
between the company and its board. The second sentence, which
is occasionally negotiable, indicates the desire for the company to
purchase formal liability insurance. One can usually negotiate away
insurance in a Series A deal, but for any follow-on financing the
major practice today is to procure directors' and officers' (D&O)
insurance. We believe companies should be willing to indemnify
their directors and will likely need to purchase D&O insurance in
order to attract outside board members.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

You should have reasonable and customary D&O insurance for yourself as much
as for your VCs. While the indemnification clause is good corporate hygiene,
make sure you follow it up with an appropriate insurance policy.

## Assignment

We end this chapter with the assignment clause, another clause in
a typical term sheet that isn't worth spending legal time and money
negotiating.

Assignment: Each of the Investors shall be entitled to transfer
all or part of its shares of Series A Preferred purchased by it to
one or more affiliated partnerships or funds managed by it or
any of their respective directors, officers, or partners, provided
such transferee agrees in writing to be subject to the terms of the
Stock Purchase Agreement and related agreements as if it were
a purchaser thereunder.

The assignment clause simply gives VC firms flexibility over trans-
fers that they require to be able to run their business and, as long as
the VC is willing to require that any transferee agree to be subject
to the various financing agreements, the company should be willing
to provide for this. However, watch out for one thing-don't let the
loophole "assignment without transfer of the obligation under the
agreements" occur. You need to make sure that anyone who is on
the receiving end of a transfer abides by the same rules and condi-
tions that the original purchasers of the stock signed up for.

# CHAPTER


# The Capitalization Table

N.
ow that we've worked through all of the specific clauses in the
term sheet, let's go through how a typical capitalization table (cap
table) works. A term sheet will almost always contain a summary
cap table, which we describe in this chapter. You, your prospective
investors, or occasionally your lawyers will generate a more detailed
cap table.

The cap table summarizes who owns what part of the company
before and after the financing. This is one area that some founders,
especially those who have not been exposed in the past to cap table
math, are often uncomfortable with. It's extremely important for
founders to understand exactly who owns what part of a company
and what the implications are in a potential funding round.

Normally when you initially set up the company, 100% will be
allocated to the founders and employees, with a specific number of
shares allocated to each individual. The question "What will I own
if a venture capitalist invests X in my company at a Y valuation?" is
rarely simple. To answer it, you need to be able to generate a cap
table to truly analyze the deal presented by a particular term sheet.
Following is a model to work from with a typical example.

Let's assume the following:

2 million shares held by founders before the VC invests
$10 million pre-money valuation
$5 million investment by the VC

<!-- PageNumber="103" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="104" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

In this example, the post-money valuation is $15 million ($10 mil-
lion pre-money + $5 million investment). Consequently, the VCs
own 33.33% of the company after the financing ($5 million invest-
ment/$15 million post-money valuation). This should be pretty
straightforward so far.

Now, assume the term sheet includes a new employee option
pool of 20% on a post-money basis. Remember that this means that
after the financing, there will be an unallocated option pool equal
to 20% of the company.

Although the post-money valuation remains the same ($15 mil-
lion), the requirement for a 20% option pool will have a significant
impact on the ownership of the founders. Per the cap table, you
can see how we calculate the percentage ownership for each class
of owner, along with the price per share of the preferred stock. To
start, we've filled in the known numbers and now have to solve for
the unknowns (A, B, C, D, and E).

First, let's solve for A, the founders' ownership percentage: A =
100% minus the VC percentage minus the employee pool percent-
age, or 100% - 33.33% - 20% = 46.67%. Given that we know that the
2 million founders' shares represent 46.67% of the company, we can
determine that the total shares outstanding (E = 2 million/ 0.4667)
are 4,285,408. Now, if there are 4,285,408 shares outstanding, deter-
mining the number of shares in the employee pool becomes B = E
*0.20 or 857,081.

The same math applies for C, the number of shares of preferred
stock the VCs have. C = E * 0.3333 or 1,428,326. Since $5 million
bought 1,428,326 shares of preferred stock, then the price per share
of preferred stock (D = $5 million/1,428,326) is $3.50 per share.

Finally, always check your calculation. Since we know we have a
$10 million pre-money valuation, then the shares prior to the financ-
ing (2 million founders' shares plus the 20% option pool) times the
price per share should equal $10 million. If you do this math, you'll

see that (2 million + 857,081) * $3.50 = $9,999,783.50. Oops, we are
off by $216.50, which represents 62 shares (well, 61.857 shares).

While this is close enough for an example, it's not close enough
for most VCs, or for most lawyers for that matter. And it shouldn't
be close enough for you. That's why most cap tables have two addi-
tional significant digits (or fractional shares)-the rounding to the
nearest share doesn't happen during intermediate steps but only at
the very end.

As the entrepreneur, you shouldn't blindly rely on legal counsel
to generate these documents. There are a lot of good lawyers out
there with poor math skills, and the cap table can get messed up
when left in the hands of the lawyers. Although some get it right, it's
your responsibility as the entrepreneur to make sure you understand
your cap table. This will be especially helpful at times when you want
to expand the employee option pool and you are eloquent in front
of your board of directors explaining the ramifications.


# The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If you do not have a great financially oriented founder, find someone who
knows what she's doing to help you with the cap table-not just someone who
knows math (a good starting point!), but someone who knows cap tables and
VC financings.

# Convertible Debt

I,
n the past few chapters we've gone through, in detail, the terms
in a typical venture capital equity financing. However, there is one
other type of financing, often used at the seed stage, called a con-
vertible debt financing. In fact, many angel investors will invest only
with this structure.

Convertible debt is just that: debt. It's a loan. The loan will con-
vert to equity (preferred stock, usually) at such time as another
round is raised. The conversion usually includes some sort of dis-
count on the price to the future round.

For example, assume you raise $500,000 in convertible debt
from angels with a 20% discount to the next round, and six months
later a venture capitalist (VC) offers to lead a Series A round of a
$1 million investment at $1 a share. Your financing will actually be
for $1.5 million total, although the VCs will get 1 million Series A
shares ($1 million at $1 per share) and the angels will get 625,000
Series A shares ($500,000 at $0.80 per share). The discount is appro-
priate, as your early investors want some reward for investing before
the full Series A financing round comes together.

In this chapter, we cover the arguments for and against using
convertible debt. We then go through the terms in a convertible
debt deal, including the discount, valuation caps, interest rate, con-
version mechanics, conversion in a sale of the company, warrants,
and other terms. We briefly cover the differences between early-stage
and late-stage dynamics and finish up with an example of when con-
vertible debt could be dangerous to use.

## Arguments For and Against Convertible Debt

Most fans of convertible debt argue that it's a much easier transaction
to complete than an equity financing. Since no valuation is being
set for the company, you get to avoid that part of the negotiation.
Because it is debt, it has few, if any, of the rights of preferred stock
offerings and you can accomplish a transaction with a lot less paper-
work and legal fees. Note, however, that the legal fees argument is
less persuasive these days with the many forms of standardized docu-
ments. A decade ago there could be a $50,000 pricing difference for
legal fees between a seed preferred round and a convertible debt
round. These days the difference is less than $10,000 since many
lawyers will heavily discount the seed preferred round to get future
business from the company.

The debate goes on endlessly about which structure is better or
worse for entrepreneurs or investors. We aren't convinced there is
a definitive answer here; in fact, we are convinced that those who
think there is a definitive answer are wrong.

Since investors usually drive the decision about whether to raise
an equity or a debt round, let's look at their motivations first. One
of the primary reasons for an early-stage investor to purchase equity
is to price the stock being sold in the round. Early-stage investing
is a risky proposition, and investors will want to invest at low prices,
although smart investors won't invest at a price at which founders
are demotivated. As a result, most early-stage deals get priced in a
pretty tight range.

With a convertible debt structure, the stock price is not set and is
determined at a later date when a larger financing occurs. By defini-
tion, if there is a later round the company must be doing something
right. Having a discount is nice, but the ultimate price for the early
convertible debt investors may still be higher than what they would
have paid if they had bought equity in the first place. Some investors
try to fix this problem by setting a cap on the price they will pay in
the next round. In other words, as an investor, I'll take a 20% dis-
count on the price of the next round up to a valuation of $X. If you
get a valuation above $X, then my valuation is $X (hence the notion
of a valuation cap).

This sounds like it fixes the problem, right? This might for the
original investor, but it might not for the company and the founders.
First of all, the investors coming into the next round may not like the

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="109" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

idea that they are paying that much more than the convertible debt
investors paid. Unlike equity, which is issued and can't be changed,
the new equity investors could refuse to fund unless the debt inves-
tors remove or change the cap. Keep in mind that VCs will normally
focus and peg their valuation of your company on that cap. You are
essentially drawing a line in the sand (albeit a small one and in some
cases it doesn't actually affect the ultimate valuation) of what your
company is worth in the future.

From the entrepreneur's standpoint, the choice isn't clear,
either. Some argue that the convertible debt structure, by definition,
leads to a higher ultimate price for the first round. We won't go as
far as to say they are right, but we can see the argument that with a
convertible debt feature you are allowing an inflated price based on
time to positively impact the valuation for the past investors. We'd
argue that this is missing half of the analysis in that a founder's first
investors are sometimes the most important. These are the people
who invested in you at the riskiest stage before anyone else would.
You like them, you respect them, and you might even be related to
them. Assume that you create a lot of value along the way and the
equity investor prices the round at a number that is higher than even
you expected. Your first investors will own less than anyone antici-
pated. At the end of the day, your biggest fans are happy about the
financing, but sad that they own so little.

But does it really set a higher price? Let's go back to the example
of a convertible debt round with a cap. If we were going to agree to
this deal, our cap would be the price that we would have agreed to
in an equity round. So, in effect, you've just sold the same amount
of equity to us, but we have an option for the price to be lower than
we would have offered you since there are plenty of scenarios in
which the equity price is below the cap amount. Why on earth would
I agree to a cap that is above the price that I'm willing to pay today?
The cap amounts to a ceiling on your price. VCs will focus on that
cap as well. There are plenty of situations where the VCs would have
been willing to pay $X per share, but after seeing the cap number in
due diligence prior to a term sheet they offer only $Y (less than $X)
per share because it's within the cap. So while you may have gotten
a better deal on your seed round, your Series A round (which nor-
mally sees the company raising a lot more money than a seed round)
is now underpriced compared to what it could be. In the aggregate,
the company actually underpriced itself in this scenario.

### The Entrepreneur's Perspective

To attract seed-stage investors, consider a convertible debt deal with two addi-
tional features: a reasonable time horizon on an equity financing and a forced
conversion if that horizon isn't met, as well as a floor, not a ceiling, on the con-
version valuation.

There's also some dissonance here since VCs spend a lot of their
time valuing companies and negotiating on price. If your VC can't or
won't do this, what is this telling you? Do you and the VC have radi-
cally different views of the value proposition you've created? Will this
impact the relationship going forward or the way that each of you
strategically thinks about your company?


## The Discount

Remember that a convertible debt deal doesn't purchase equity in
your company. Instead, it's simply a loan that has the ability to con-
vert to equity based on some future financing event. Let's begin our
discussion of terms for convertible debt with the most important
one, the discount.

Until recently, we had never seen a convertible debt deal that
didn't convert at a discount to the next financing round. Given some
of the current excited market conditions at the seed stage, we've
heard of convertible deals with no discount but view this as irregular
and not sustainable over the long term.

The idea behind the discount is that investors should get, or
require, more upside than just the interest rate associated with
the debt for the risk that they are taking by investing early. These
investors aren't banks-they are planning to own equity in the
company, but are simply deferring the price discussion to the next
financing.

So how does the discount work? There are two approaches: the
discounted price to the next round and warrants. We'll cover the
discounted price approach in this section, as it's much simpler and
better oriented for a seed round investment.

For the discounted price to the next round, you might see some-
thing like this in the legal documents:

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="111" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

This Note shall automatically convert in whole without any
further action by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a
conversion price equal to eighty percent (80%) of the price per
share paid by the Investors purchasing the Equity Securities on
the same terms and conditions as given to the Investors.

This means that if your next round investors are paying $1 per
share, then the note will convert into the same shares at a 20%
discount, or $0.80 per share. For example, if you have a $100,000
convertible note, it will purchase 125,000 shares ($100,000/$0.80)
whereas the new equity investor will get 100,000 shares for his invest-
ment of $100,000 ($100,000/$1).

The range of discounts we typically see is 10 to 30%, with 20%
being the most common. While occasionally you'll see a discount
that increases over time (e.g., 10% if the round closes in 90 days,
20% if it takes longer), we generally recommend entrepreneurs
(and investors) keep this simple-it is the seed round, after all.


## Valuation Caps

The next economic term is the valuation cap, also known as the cap.
The cap is an investor-favorable term that puts a ceiling on the con-
version price of the debt. The valuation cap is typically seen in seed
rounds where the investors are concerned that the next round of
financing will be at a price that is at a valuation that wouldn't reward
them appropriately for taking a risk by investing early in the seed
round.

For example, an investor wants to invest $100,000 in a company
and thinks that the pre-money valuation of the company is some-
where in the $2 million to $4 million range. The entrepreneur
thinks the valuation should be higher. Either way, the investor and
the entrepreneur agree to not deal with a valuation negotiation and
instead decide to consummate a convertible debt deal with a 20%
discount to the next round.

Nine months pass and the company is doing well. The entrepre-
neur is happy and the investor is happy. The company goes to raise a
round of financing in the form of preferred stock. It receives a term
sheet at a $20 million pre-money valuation. In this case, the discount
of 20% would result in the investor having an effective valuation of
$16 million for his investment nine months ago.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="112 Venture Deals" -->

On one hand, the investor is happy for the entrepreneur; but on
the other hand, he is shocked by the relatively high valuation for his
investment. He realizes he made a bad decision by not pricing the
deal initially, as anything below $16 million would have been better
for him. Of course, this is nowhere near the $2 million to $4 million
the investor was contemplating the company was worth at the time
he made the convertible debt investment.

The valuation cap addresses this situation. By agreeing on a cap,
the entrepreneur and the investor can still defer the price discussion
but set a ceiling at which point the conversion price caps.

In our previous example, let's assume that the entrepreneur and
the investor agree on a $4 million cap. Since the deal has a 20%
discount, any valuation up to $5 million will result in the investor
getting a discount of 20%. Once the discounted value goes above
the cap, then the cap will apply. So, in the case of the $20 million
pre-money valuation, the investor will get shares at an effective price
of $4 million.

As we've mentioned, in some cases, caps can impact the valua-
tion of the next round. Some VCs will look at the cap and view it as
a price ceiling to the next round price, assuming that it was the high
point negotiated between the seed investors and the entrepreneur.
To mitigate this, entrepreneurs should try not to disclose the seed
round terms until a price has been agreed to with a new VC investor.
Lately, we've been seeing a lot of VCs ask for the terms of the con-
vertible debt round before they are willing to issue a term sheet. We
understand that it is hard for an entrepreneur to say no to a poten-
tial funding partner's requests.

Clearly, entrepreneurs would prefer not to have valuation caps.
However, many seed investors recognize that an uncapped note has
the potential to create a big risk/return disparity, especially in frothy
markets for early-stage deals. We believe that-over the long term-
caps create more alignment between entrepreneurs and seed inves-
tors as long as the price cap is thoughtfully negotiated based on the
stage of the company.


## Interest Rate

Since convertible debt is a loan, it almost always has an interest rate
associated with it, as that's the minimum upside an investor is going
to want to have for the investment.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="113" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

We believe interest rates on convertible debt should be as low
as possible. This isn't bank debt, and the investors are being fairly
compensated through the use of whatever type of discount has been
negotiated. If you are an entrepreneur, check out what the appli-
cable federal rates (AFRs) are to see the lowest legally allowable interest
rates; bump them up just a little bit (for volatility), and suggest what-
ever that number is.

Realizing that the discount and the interest rate are often
linked, we'll usually see an interest rate between 4% and 12% (the
median is 8%) associated with a discount between 10% and 30%
(the median is 20%).


## Conversion Mechanics

Eventually the convertible debt will convert into equity. There are
several nuances around how and when the note will convert. These
conversion mechanics are important but can usually be configured in a
way where everyone will be happy with them if they concentrate on
defining them up front.

In general, debt holders have traditionally enjoyed superior
control rights over companies and the ability to force nasty things
like bankruptcy and involuntary liquidations. Therefore, hav-
ing outstanding debt (that doesn't convert) can be a bad thing
if an entrepreneur ever gets sideways with one of the debt hold-
ers. While it's not talked about that much, it happens, and we've
seen situations where the debt holder has excessive power in a
negotiation.

Here is typical conversion language:

In the event that Payor issues and sells shares of its Equity Securi-
ties to investors (the "Investors") on or before [180] days from
the date herewith (the "Maturity Date") in an equity financ-
ing with total proceeds to the Payor of not less than $1 million
(excluding the conversion of the Notes or other debt) (a "Quali-
fied Financing"), then the outstanding principal balance of this
Note shall automatically convert in whole without any further
action by the Holders into such Equity Securities at a conversion
price equal to the price per share paid by the Investors purchas-
ing the Equity Securities on the same terms and conditions as
given to the Investors.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="114" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Let's take a look at what matters in this paragraph. Notice that
in order for the note to convert automatically, all of the conditions
must be met. If not, there is no automatic conversion.

· Term. Here, the company must sell equity within six months
(180 days) for the debt to automatically convert. Consider
whether this is enough time. If we were entrepreneurs, we'd
try to get this period to be as long as possible. Many venture
firms are not allowed (by their agreements with their inves-
tors) to issue debt that has a maturity date longer than a year,
so don't be surprised if one year is the maximum that you can
negotiate if you are dealing with a VC investor.

· Amount. In this case the company must raise $1,000,000 of new
money for the debt to convert because the conversion of the
outstanding debt is excluded. The entrepreneur often gets
to decide the amount based on the minimum the company
is hoping to raise. When you determine this number, think
about how long you have (180 days in this example) and how
much you think you can reasonably raise in that time period.

So what happens if the company does not achieve the milestones
to automatically convert the debt? The debt stays outstanding unless
the debt holders agree to convert their holdings. This is when vot-
ing control comes into play. It is important to pay attention to the
amendment provision in the notes.

Any term of this Note may be amended or waived with the writ-
ten consent of Payor and the Majority Holders. Upon the effec-
tuation of such waiver or amendment in conformance with this
Section 11, the Payor shall promptly give written notice thereof
to the record Holders of the Notes who have not previously con-
sented thereto in writing.

While one will never see anything less than a majority of holders
needing to consent to an amendment (and thus a different standard
for conversion), make sure the standard doesn't get too high. For
instance, if you had two parties splitting $1 million in convertible
debt with a 60/40 percentage split, you only need one party to con-
sent if the majority rules, but both parties would need to consent if
a supermajority must approve. Little things like this can make a big

difference if the 40% holder is the one you aren't getting along with
at the present moment.


## Conversion in a Sale of the Company

What happens to the convertible debt if the company gets acquired
before there is an equity financing and before the debt is converted
to equity? There are a few different scenarios.

The investor gets its money back plus interest. If there is no specific
language addressing this situation, this is what usually ends up hap-
pening. In this case, the convertible debt document doesn't allow
the debt to convert into anything, but at the same time mandates
that upon a sale the debt must be paid off. So the investors don't see
any of the upside on the acquisition. The potentially bad news is that
if the merger is an all-stock deal, the company will need to find a way
to find cash to pay back the loan or negotiate a way for the acquiring
company to deal with the debt.

The investor gets its money back, plus interest plus a multiple of the orig-
inal principal amount. In this case, the documents dictate that the
company will pay back outstanding principal plus interest and then
a multiple on the original investment. Usually we see a multiple of
two to three times, but in later-stage companies this multiple can be
even higher. Typical language follows:

Sale of the Company: If a Qualified Financing has not occurred
and the Company elects to consummate a sale of the Company
prior to the Maturity Date, then notwithstanding any provision
of the Notes to the contrary (i) the Company will give the Inves-
tors at least five days prior written notice of the anticipated clos-
ing date of such sale of the Company and (ii) the Company will
pay the holder of each Note an aggregate amount equal to
times the aggregate amount of principal and interest then out-
standing under such Note in full satisfaction of the Company's
obligations under such Note.

Some sort of conversion does occur. In the case of an early-stage com-
pany that hasn't issued preferred stock yet, the debt converts into
stock of the acquiring company (if it's a stock deal) at a valuation
subject to a cap. If it's not a stock deal, then one normally sees one
of the preceding scenarios.

<!-- PageNumber="116" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

With later-stage companies, the investors usually structure the
convertible notes to have the most flexibility. They either get a mul-
tiple payout on the debt or get the equity upside based on the pre-
vious preferred round price. Note that if the acquisition price is
low, the holders of the debt may usually opt out of conversion and
demand cash payment on the notes.

While in many cases issuing convertible debt is easier to deal
with than issuing equity, the one situation where this often becomes
complex is an acquisition while the debt is outstanding. Our strong
advice is to address in the documents how the debt will be handled
in an acquisition.


## Warrants

A few sections ago we discussed the "discounted price to the next
round" approach to providing a discount on convertible debt. The
other approach to a discount is to issue warrants. This approach
is more complex and usually applies only to situations where the
company has already raised a round of equity, but it occasionally
pops up in early-stage deals. If you are doing a seed round, we
encourage you not to use this approach and instead save some
legal fees. However, if you are doing a later-stage convertible debt
round or your investors insist on you issuing warrants, here's how
it works.

Assume that once again the investor is investing $100,000 and
receives warrant coverage in the amount of 20% of the amount of
the convertible note. In this case the investor will get a warrant for
$20,000.

This is where it can get a little tricky. What does $20,000 worth of
warrants mean? A warrant is an option to purchase a certain number
of shares at a predetermined price. But how do you figure out the
number of warrants and the price that the warrants will be at? There
are numerous different ways to calculate this, such as:

· $20,000 worth of common stock at the last value ascribed to
either the common or the preferred stock.

· $20,000 worth of the last round of preferred stock at that
round's price of the stock.

· $20,000 worth of the next round of preferred stock at what-
ever price that happens to be.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="117" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

As you can see, the actual percentage of the company associated
with the warrants can vary greatly depending on the price of the
security that underlies it. As a bonus, the particular ownership of
certain classes may affect voting control of a particular class of stock.

If there is a standard, it's the second version, where the war-
rants are attached to the prior preferred stock round. If there is
no prior preferred, then one normally sees the stock convert to the
next preferred round unless an acquisition of the company occurs
before a preferred round is consummated; in that case, it reverts to
the common stock.

For example, assume that the round gets done at $1 per share
as in the previous example. The investor who holds a $100,000 con-
vertible note will get $20,000 of warrants, or 20,000 warrants at an
exercise price of $1, to go along with the 100,000 shares received in
the financing from the conversion of the note.

Warrants have a few extra terms that matter.

· Term length. The length of time the warrants are exercisable,
which is typically 5 to 10 years. Shorter is better for the entre-
preneur and company. Longer is better for the investor.

· Merger considerations. What happens to the warrants in the event
the company is acquired? We can't opine more strongly that
all warrants should expire at a merger unless they are exer-
cised just prior to the transaction. In other words, the warrant
holder must decide to either exercise or give up the warrants
if the company is acquired. Acquiring companies hate buying
companies that have warrants that survive a merger and allow
the warrant holder to buy equity in the acquirer. Many merg-
ers have been held up because warrants with this feature have
upset the potential acquirer and thus as part of the closing
requirements the acquirer has mandated that the company
go out and repurchase or edit the terms of the warrants. This
is not a good negotiating spot for the company to find itself
in, as it will have to pay off warrant holders while disclosing
the potential merger (so the company will have little leverage)
and at the same time will have a sword hanging over its head
by the acquirer until the issue is resolved.

· Original issue discount (OID). This is an accounting issue that
is boring, yet important. If a convertible debt deal includes
warrants, the warrants must be paid for separately in order to

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="118" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

avoid the OID issue. In other words, if the debt is for $100,000
and there is 20% warrant coverage, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) says that the warrants themselves have some
value. If there is no provision for the actual purchase of the
warrants, the investor will have received an original issue dis-
count, which says that the $100,000 debt was issued at a dis-
count since the investor also received warrants. The problem
is that part of the $100,000 principal repaid will be included
as interest to the investor or, even worse, it will be accrued as
income over the life of the note even before any payments are
made. The easy fix is to pay something for the warrants, which
usually is an amount in the low thousands of dollars.

The difference between warrants and a discount is probably
insignificant for the investor. We suppose if the investor is able to
get warrants for common stock, then perhaps the ultimate value of
warrants may outweigh the discount, but it's not clear. As evidenced
by the number of words we have devoted to the topic, warrants add
a fair amount of complexity and legal costs to the mix. However,
some discounts will include valuation caps, and that can create some
negative company valuation ramifications while warrants completely
stay away from the valuation discussion. Warrants are not nearly as
popular as they once were as discounts are more typically used.

Finally, in no case should an entrepreneur let an investor double
dip and receive both a discount and warrants. That's not a reason-
able position for investors to take-they should either get a discount
or get warrants.


## Other Terms

There are a few other terms that can show up in a convertible debt
deal. You'll recognize these from the earlier chapters on terms in
an equity financing, as they are the terms that more sophisticated
angels or seed investors will insist on to preserve their rights in later
financings.

The first term you'll occasionally see in a convertible debt financ-
ing is a pro rata right, which will allow debt holders to participate pro-
ratably in a future financing. Since the dollars invested in a convert-
ible debt deal are often small, investors may ask for super pro rata
rights. For instance, if an investor invests $500,000 in a convertible

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="119" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

debt deal and the company later raises $7 million, the investor's pro
rata investment rights wouldn't allow the investor to purchase a large
portion of the next round. As a result, the seed investor may ask for a
pro rata right for two to four times the investor's current ownership
or for a specific percentage (say 5% to 20%) of the next financing.
While pro rata rights are pretty typical, if you have people asking for
super pro rata rights or a specific portion of the next financing, you
should be careful, as granting these will limit your long-term financ-
ing options.

Every now and then you'll see a liquidation preference in a con-
vertible debt deal. It works the same way as in a preferred stock
deal: the investors get their money back first, or a multiple of their
money back first, before any proceeds are distributed to anyone
else. This usually happens in the case when a company is struggling
to raise capital and current investors offer a convertible debt (also
called a bridge loan) deal to the company. Back in the good old
days, usury laws prevented such terms, but in most states this is not
an issue and the investors are allowed to have not only the security
of holding debt, but the upside of preferred stock should a liquida-
tion event occur.


## Early-Stage versus Late-Stage Dynamics

Traditionally, convertible debt was issued by mid- to late-stage start-
ups that needed a financing to get them to a place where they
believed they could raise more money. Thus, these deals were called
bridge financings.

The terms were basically the same unless the company was per-
forming poorly and there was doubt about the ability to raise new
capital, or the bridge was to get the company to an acquisition or
an orderly shutdown. In these cases, one saw terms like liquidation
preferences and in some cases changes to board or voting control
come into play. Some of these bridge loans also contained terms like
pay-to-play, which we discussed in Chapter 4.

Given the traditional complexity and cost of legal fees associated
with preferred stock financings, however, convertible debt became
a common way to make seed-stage investments, as it tended to be
simpler and less expensive from a legal perspective. Over time,
equity rounds have become cheaper to consummate, and the legal
fees argument doesn't carry much weight these days. In the end, the

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="120" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

main force driving the use of convertible debt in early-stage compa-
nies is the parties' desire to avoid setting a valuation.


## Can Convertible Debt Be Dangerous?

One final issue with convertible debt is a technical legal one. You'll
have to forgive us, but Jason is an ex-lawyer and sometimes we can't
keep him in his cage.

If a company raises cash via equity, it has a positive balance sheet.
It is solvent (assets are greater than obligations), and the board and
executives have fiduciary duties to the shareholders in the efforts
to maximize company value. The shareholders are all the usual sus-
pects: the employees and VCs. Life is good and normal.

However, if a company is insolvent, the board and company may
(based in large part on state law-ask your attorney) now owe fidu-
ciary duties to the creditors of the company. By definition, if you
raise a convertible debt round, your company is insolvent. You have
cash, but your debt obligations are greater than your assets. Your
creditors include your landlord, anyone you owe money to (includ-
ing former disgruntled employees), and founders who have lawyers.

How does this change the paradigm? To be fair, we have had no
personal war stories here, but it's not hard to construct some weird
situations.

Let's look at the hypothetical situation.

Assume the company is not a success and fails. In the case of
raising equity, the officers and directors owe a duty only to the credi-
tors (e.g., the landlord) at such time that cash isn't large enough to
pay their liabilities. If the company manages it correctly, creditors
are paid off cleanly even on the downside scenario. But sometimes
it doesn't happen this way and there are lawsuits. When the lawyers
get involved, they'll look to establish the time in which the company
went insolvent and then try to show that the actions of the board
were bad during that time. If the time frame is short, it's hard to
make a case against the company.

However, if you raise debt, the insolvency time lasts until your
debt converts into equity. As a result, if your company ends up fail-
ing and you can't pay your creditors, the ability for a plaintiff lawyer
to judge your actions has increased dramatically. And don't forget:
if you have any outstanding employment litigation, all of these folks
count as creditors as well.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="121" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Convertible Debt" -->

The worst part of this is that many states impose personal liability
on directors for things that occur while a company is insolvent. This
means that some states will allow creditors to sue directors personally
for not getting all of the money they are owed.

Now, we don't want to get too crazy here. We are talking about
early-stage and seed companies, and hopefully the situation is clean
enough that these doomsday predictions won't happen, but our bet
is that few folks participating in convertible debt rounds are actually
thinking about these issues. While we don't know of any actual cases
out there, we've been around this business long enough to know that
there is constant innovation in the plaintiff's bar as well.


## An Alternative to Convertible Debt

Over the years, in addition to efforts to standardize early-stage financ-
ing documents, there have been several attempts to create a synthetic
early-stage financing instrument that combines the best characteris-
tics of equity and debt. The most recent, and most popular instru-
ment was created several years ago by Y Combinator and is called the
safe (Simple Agreement for Future Equity). It was followed quickly
by 500 Startups' version called KISS (Keep It Simple Security), dem-
onstrating once again that document standardization is not a reality
in the world of startups, at least as long as lawyers are involved.

The idea of the safe (yes, the phrasing "the safe" is deliberate, as
it's intended to be analogous to "the note," which is how convertible
notes are often referred to) is that the investor buys what effectively
is an unpriced warrant in the company, as opposed to buying con-
vertible debt. This eliminates some of the concerns around using
debt, including the edge case issues around legal dynamics of debt,
and eliminates some features of debt such as interest.

As with convertible debt, the safe can have a cap and/or a dis-
count. An MFN, or most favored nation clause, can also be included so
that if better terms are given to future investors, they are automati-
cally inherited by the safe investors.

For investors, the safe has several disadvantages over convertible
notes, such as the lack of an explicit pro-rata right in the following
round. As with convertible notes, this can be added, but at some
level this undermines the idea of a simple, standard document.

The lack of maturity date is both an advantage and a disadvan-
tage. While it eliminates the risk for the entrepreneur associated with

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="122" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

a maturity date with debt, it simultaneously eliminates the require-
ment for the entrepreneurs to communicate with the investors at
least around the timing of the maturity date. In many convertible
debt situations, investors will simply extend the maturity date. How-
ever, in some situations, especially ones where companies are strug-
gling and the entrepreneurs are not communicating with the inves-
tors, the lack of a maturity date takes away a key leverage point-at
least for a discussion-from the investors.

As with convertible debt, the safe punts on many of the key issues
(the most important of these being valuation) that are addressed
with an equity round enabling both founders and investors to defer,
or be lazy about, issues until the next financing round.

# Crowdfunding

W
hen we wrote the first version of this book in 2011, the idea of
using crowdfunding as a financing mechanism was nascent. Since
then, it has emerged as a powerful approach, both for product
development and equity financing. In this chapter we will discuss
the various crowdfunding approaches and legal implications, and
how crowdfunding differs from more traditional methods.


## Product Crowdfunding

Crowdfunding typically refers to two different approaches that are
relevant to financing companies. The first, popularized by Kick-
starter and Indiegogo, is product crowdfunding.

Product crowdfunding is typically used for physical products. The
company puts its product idea up on Kickstarter along with content
showing what the product will do and a series of different rewards
for backers. In most cases, the product is in an early design stage and
far from ready to ship. The rewards vary by dollar amount and often
include things that, while linked to the product, are experiential or
tangential to the product, such as logoed stickers and T-shirts, spon-
sorship recognition, or real-world events to celebrate the launch of
the product.

Most campaigns have a 30-day funding target that, if not achieved,
results in the campaign failing and funding not occurring. This is
the hardware equivalent of building a software minimum-viable product
(MVP). If the campaign is successful, you know you have a compelling

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="123" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="124" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

MVP. If the campaign does not reach its funding target, your poten-
tial customers are telling you that your MVP is not interesting enough
to pursue.

Several high profile products got their start on Kickstarter,
including the Pebble Watch (which raised $10.2 million in 30 days)
and Oculus Rift (which raised $2.5 million in 30 days). Companies
have also had similar successes on Indiegogo, such as TrackR, which
raised $1.7 million.

If this sounds similar to a preorder campaign, it is, and you will
also hear people refer to them as "presales" or "preorders." While
Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and other crowdfunding sites are growing
rapidly, some companies, such as Glowforge, have decided to run
their own preorder campaigns. In Glowforge's case, they raised
$27.9 million in 30 days, demonstrating that if you have a compel-
ling product and are sophisticated around marketing and promoting
your product, you can run a very successful preorder campaign on
your own.

The crowdfunding approach can even be rolled into your busi-
ness model. When we invested in Betabrand, they were building
a two-sided clothing marketplace that incorporated the notion of
crowdfunding into their design process. Individual designers can
create new designs that are then promoted on Betabrand's website.
Customers preorder the designs and if a certain preorder threshold
is met, the design is produced and becomes a permanent product in
Betabrand's catalog.

In each of these cases, one of the large advantages of this
approach is that the funding is nondilutive as no equity is involved.
Instead of selling equity or debt, you are preselling a product and
collecting the cash up front.

The downside of product crowdfunding is the situation where a
campaign is successful but the company doesn't finish building the
product. In some cases, the company is able to raise addition capital,
often equity, to complete the product and fulfill the preorders. In
others, the company never ships the product or only fulfills some
aspect of the campaign. While this situation is disappointing, the
culture around product crowdfunding is such that these failures
are understood to be part of the process, in the same way that invest-
ing equity in a company does not necessarily result in a successful
company and a return on the investment.

## Equity Crowdfunding

The second crowdfunding approach, popularized by AngelList, is
equity crowdfunding. This approach pertains to the situation when
an investor gives money to a company in exchange for a security
(either debt or equity) through an intermediated process, often
involving an online funding platform. These platforms, such as
AngelList, allow companies to essentially advertise their funding or
use the power of a social network to attract other investor interest.
Evolved approaches, such as AngelList Syndicates, allow individual
investors to aggregate other investors to participate in their syndicate,
acting like a small version of a venture capital fund.

While crowdfunding has expanded to cover many different situ-
ations, there are tight legal definitions surrounding each approach
that were defined as part of the JOBS Act (the full name is the Jump-
start Our Business Startups Act) that was passed in 2012. As a result,
some of the aspects of fundraising on platforms like AngelList are
referred to as crowdfunding, but are really not anything new, other
than the use of an online platform to connect companies with poten-
tial investors.

In the United States, if you are selling a security, you need to
register the security with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) unless you have an exemption not to. A security is any finan-
cial instrument that gives you an ownership interest in a company,
including common stock, preferred stock, or convertible debt. This
doesn't include revenue derived from product crowdfunding or a
preorder campaign. The original rules for registering securities were
defined in the Securities Act of 1933, and, while they have evolved,
are still based on rules negotiated more than 80 years ago.

Fortunately, there are a number of exemptions that allow you
to avoid an SEC registration. In general, unless you are taking a
company public via initial public offering (IPO), you won't have to
worry about registering your offering with the SEC. However, there
are important guidelines that you must follow in order not to blow
up your ability to rely on an exemption. The two most important to
understand are the concept of an accredited investor and the process
of general solicitation.

An accredited investor is a person who has a substantial net worth
or income, as defined by the SEC and changed from time to time.
In most cases, entities such as a VC, a corporation with meaningful

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="126" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

assets, or a registered bank automatically qualify. An individual quali-
fies if she earns $200,000 per year or has a joint income with her spouse
of $300,000 and this level has been earned in the previous two years
and can be reasonably expected to be earned in the future. If an indi-
vidual doesn't have this level of income, she can qualify if she has a net
worth exceeding $1 million either alone or jointly with her spouse.

Unlike an accredited investor, the SEC does not clearly define
what is considered to be general solicitation, instead leaving it open
to interpretation. Historically, general solicitation referred to adver-
tising or publicly promoting your fundraising, such as specifically
making a financing ask in public at an accelerator demo day. Depend-
ing on your lawyer and how conservative you are, the line of where
general solicitation is crossed is vague, but the simple test is that if
you don't have a preexisting relationship with someone and encoun-
ter them through something that looks like an advertisement (which
could include a mass email, rather than a one-on-one introduction),
then you are likely in the general solicitation bucket.

Prior to the JOBS Act, one wanted to avoid raising money from
investors who were not accredited as well as avoid general solicitation.
With the JOBS Act, the rules changed somewhat.

While there are an endless number of $99 courses on how to
raise money for your company using crowdfunding, our friend Brad
Bernthal, a law professor at CU Boulder, created the following chart
as a summary of the implications of the three major crowdfunding
and financing aspects of the JOBS Act. These are known as Rule
506(b), Rule 506(c)/Title II, and Title III.

<tr>

Prior to Title II of the JOBS Act, if you generally solicited, you
had broken the law and could not raise money. Prior to Title III of

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="127" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Crowdfunding" -->

the JOBS Act, it was next to impossible to raise a meaningful amount
of money from nonaccredited investors.

From a legal perspective, equity crowdfunding is really only
Title III, where nonaccredited investors can participate. Not surpris-
ingly, this is also the most heavily regulated approach. A company is
limited to raising $1 million over a 12-month period and it can only
solicit through one online funding portal or with a broker. While
nonaccredited investors can participate in a Title III financing, there
are limits on the size of individual investments, which, depending on
the investor's net worth, can be as little at $2,000. Finally, there is a
significant burden of SEC-mandated information disclosures that can
easily cost a company tens of thousands of dollars to comply with.

Even though the phrase crowdfunding gets regularly applied
to financings done on AngelList and other online platforms, this is
often more around marketing the platform than it is around the sub-
stance of investing. Most of the financings done on AngelList happen
under the 506(b) rules, which is similar to how most VC financings
have historically been done. In some cases, companies use 506(c) so
they can advertise more widely on a site like AngelList, but still only
accept accredited investors. In these situations, there are additional
regulations to ensure their investors are, indeed, accredited.


## How Equity Crowdfunding Differs

A difference between equity crowdfunding and a more traditional
financing is that with crowdfunding you are often setting the terms
of the deal. Most sites allow you to determine the form of security
you are issuing (equity versus debt) and to set all the major terms.
While this is occasionally negotiated with a lead investor, in our expe-
rience most companies do not see much pushback on the terms they
propose as long as they are reasonable.

While convertible debt financings are generally straightforward,
they typically include a specific cap. With equity financings, a very
light preferred stock with minimal protective provisions and terms
are often used. Board seats, at least as part of the crowdfunding
activity, are rarely offered.

The materials you put together include a traditional executive
summary and a PowerPoint presentation. When raising online,
you often get opportunities to spice things up with a fancy video,

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="128 Venture Deals" -->

specific data about your recent performance, and continuous
refreshes on this background information as time passes during
the financing process.

In a VC-backed fundraise, you are often getting one or more
self-proclaimed experts (the VC) involved in your company in an
actively engaged way, either as a mentor, coach, networker, or board
member. In crowdfunding situations, you are getting a crowd. While
you may have a lead investor, you will now have many small investors
who may, or may not, be focused on helping your company. Their
investment may be a tiny dollar amount for them and they may have
many separate small investments. Consequently, the responsibility
on communication and engagement will be on you as it's unlikely
that many of your new investors will proactively reach out to help.
While this is similar to a situation where you raise money tradition-
ally from a bunch of individual angels, it's a common dynamic in
crowdfunding deals.

We've observed some companies end up being stranded after a
crowdfunding round. These companies either can't, or don't, raise
enough money in the crowdfunding round and find themselves
without money and with a noncommitted investor syndicate. Often,
these companies are not mature enough to attract a VC financing
and end up in a situation where they are too early for VCs, yet don't
have meaningful support from their existing crowd of investors.

Finally, watch out for the jerks. We've seen situations where
one or more members of a crowdfunded financing feel overly self-
important, construct belief systems around the company that are
delusional, or simply regret investing and try to exert pressure on
the founders in inappropriate ways. While some angel investors for-
get that they are supposed to be "angels" instead of "devils," some
crowdfunding participants don't appear to have subscribed to the
angel notion to begin with. While some of this results from lack of
sophistication of some investors in crowdfunding deals, there often
is less concern about reputational constraints given the dynamics of
crowdfunding as compared to angel or VC investing. A final chal-
lenge with crowdfunding platforms is that it's more difficult for the
entrepreneur to do detailed diligence on the crowd, so beware of
the squeaky wheel who can be a real pain in the neck.

# How Venture Capital Funds Work

B
efore we talk about the dynamics of negotiating the deal, it's
useful to understand the motivation of the person you'll be negotiat-
ing against, namely, the venture capitalist (VC). We've been asked
many times to divulge the deep, dark secrets of what makes VCs tick.
One night over dinner we talked through much of this with a very
experienced entrepreneur who was in the middle of a negotiation
for a late stage round for his company. At the end of the discus-
sion, he implored us to put pen to paper since even though he was
extremely experienced and had been involved in several VC-backed
companies, our conversation helped him understand the nuances
of what he was dealing with, which, until our explanation, had been
confusing him.

In general, it's important to understand what drives your current
and future business partners-namely, your VCs-as their motiva-
tions will impact your business. While the basics of how a venture
fund works may be known, in this chapter we try to also cover all the
nonobvious issues that play into how VCs think and behave. To do
that, we'll dive into how funds are set up and managed as well as the
pressures (both internally and externally) that VCs face.


## Overview of a Typical Structure

Let's start by describing a typical VC fund structure (see illustration).
There are three basic entities that make up the fund. The first entity
is the management company and is usually owned by the senior partners.
The management company employs all of the people with whom you

<!-- PageNumber="129" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="130" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

interact at the firm, such as the partners, associates, and support staff,
and pays for all of the normal day-to-day business expenses such as the
firm's office lease, fresh fruit juicer, and monthly Internet expense.

As a result, the management company is essentially the franchise
of the firm. While old funds are retired and new funds are raised,
the management company lives on and services each of the funds
that are raised. A VC's business card almost always lists the name of
the management company, which is one of the reasons that the sig-
nature blocks on a term sheet often have a different name than the
one you are used to associating with the firm. For example, in our
case, Foundry Group is the name of our management company, not
that of the actual funds that we raise and invest from.

The next entity is the limited partnership (LP) vehicle. When a VC
talks about his "fund" or that his firm "raised a fund of $225 million,"
he is actually talking about a limited partnership vehicle that con-
tains the investors in the fund (also called limited partners, or LPs).

The final entity is one an entrepreneur rarely hears of called the
general partnership (GP) entity. This is the legal entity for serving as
the actual general partner to the fund. In some partnerships, the
individual managing directors play this role, but over time this has
evolved into a separate legal entity that the managing directors each
own on a fund-by-fund basis.

We realize this is confusing unless you are in law school, in which
case you are likely salivating with joy over the legal complexity we are
exposing you to. The key point to remember is that there is sepa-
ration between the management company (the franchise) and the
actual funds that it raises (the LP entities). These distinct entities will
often have divergent interests and motivations, especially as manag-
ing directors join or leave the venture capital firm. One managing
director may be your point of contact today, but this person may
have different alignments among his multiple organizations that will
potentially affect you.


## How Firms Raise Money

The next time you are on the fundraising trail beating your head
against the wall trying to get through to a VC about how awesome
your business is, remember that VCs also get to enjoy the same pro-
cess when raising funds. So, while we feel your pain, we also admit
that many VCs quickly forget about the whole process and inflict too
much pain on the entrepreneurs raising money. While this know-
ledge might help a little when you are sitting frustrated in your hotel
room after another day of fundraising, we encourage you to also
discover the magic soothing properties of scotch. (When Brad is
drinking, his current favorite is Lagavulin 16, while Jason has lately
been enjoying Macallan 15.)

VCs raise money from a variety of entities, including government
and corporate pension funds, large corporations, banks, professional
institutional investors, educational endowments, high-net-worth
individuals, funds of funds, charitable organizations, and insurance
companies. The arrangement between the VCs and their investors
is subject to a long, complicated contract known as the limited part-
nership agreement (LPA) that makes one thing clear: VCs have bosses
also-their investors, also known as their LPs.

When a VC firm makes an announcement that it has raised a
$100 million fund, it is not the case that the VC has $100 million
sitting in the bank waiting for a smart entrepreneur to come along.
The venture capital firm normally keeps very little cash on hand and
must ask its LPs every time it wants money to make an investment.
This is known as a capital call and it typically takes two weeks from
the moment the money is requested until it arrives. Note that the
LPs are legally obligated under the fund agreements to send the VCs
money every time they make a capital call.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="132" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

If a venture capital firm requests money and its investors say no,
things get tricky. The VC usually has some very draconian rights in
the LPA to enforce its capital call, but we've seen several moments
in history when VCs have done a capital call and there has been a
smaller amount of money to be had than anticipated. This is not
a good thing if you are the entrepreneur relying on getting a deal
done with the VC. Fortunately, this is a rare occurrence.

Why might investors refuse to fund a capital call? For one, LPs
may think the VC is making bad decisions and may want to get out
of the fund. More likely, something exogenous has happened to the
LPs and they are feeling tight on cash and can't, or don't want to,
comply with the capital call. This happened a number of times in the
global economic crisis in the fall of 2008 (and even back in 2001)
when three categories of LPs were impacted:

1\. High-net-worth individuals who were feeling lower-net-worth
at the time;

2\. Banks that had no cash available (and quickly became parts
of other banks); and

3\. Endowments, foundations, and charitable organizations that
had massive cash flow crises because of their ratio of illiquid
investments.

In many cases, the VC will find a new LP to buy the old LP's
interest. There is an active market known as a secondary market
for LPs who want to sell their interest. Economically, this is almost
always more attractive to the LP than not making a capital call, so
except in moments of extreme stress, the VC usually ends up with
the money to make an investment.


## How Venture Capitalists Make Money

Now that we've explained the structure of a typical venture capital
fund, let's explore how VCs get paid. The compensation dynamics of
a particular fund often impacts the behavior of a VC early in the life
of a company, as well as later on when the company is either succeed-
ing or struggling and needs to raise additional capital.


### Management Fees

VCs' salaries come from their funds' management fees. The manage-
ment fee is a percentage (typically between 1.5% and 2.5%) of the

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="133" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

total amount of money committed to a fund. These fees are taken
annually (paid out quarterly or semiannually) and finance the oper-
ations of the VC firm, including all of the salaries for the investing
partners and their staff. For example, if a venture capital firm raises
a $100 million fund with a 2% management fee, each year the firm
will receive $2 million in management fees. While this may seem like
a lot of money, it goes to pay all of the costs of the venture capital
firm, including employees, partners, associates, rent, flying around
the country seeing entrepreneurs, copiers, diet soda, brand-new
MacBook Airs, and a new iPhone every time Apple releases a new
version, even if it's only a change in color.

The percentage is usually inversely related to the size of fund;
the smaller the fund, the larger the percentage-but most funds
level out around 2%. There's a slight nuance, which is the fee paid
during and after the commitment period, or the period of time when
the fund can make new investments-usually the first five years. This
fee, which is usually 2% to 2.5%, begins to decrease after the end
of the commitment period. The formula varies widely, but in most
firms the average total fee over a 10-year period is about 15% of the
committed capital. So, in our previous $100 million fund example,
the typical fund will have $15 million of management fees to run its
operations and pay its people.

But wait, there's more. Most venture capital firms raise multiple
funds. The average firm raises a new fund every three or four years,
but some firms raise funds more frequently while others have mul-
tiple different fund vehicles such as an early-stage fund, a growth
stage fund, and a China fund. In these cases, the fees stack up across
funds. If a firm raises a fund every three years, it has a new manage-
ment fee that adds to its old management fee. The simple way to
think of this is that the management fee is roughly 2% of total com-
mitted capital across all funds. So, if Fund 1 is a $100 million fund
and Fund 2 is a $200 million fund, the management fee ends up
being approximately $6 million annually ($2 million for Fund 1 and
$4 million for Fund 2).

Although venture capital firms tend to grow head count (partners
and staff) as they raise new funds, this isn't always the case and the
head count rarely grows in direct proportion to the increased man-
agement fees. As a result, the senior partners of the venture capital
firm (or the ones with a managing director title) see their base com-
pensation rise with each additional fund. The dynamics vary widely

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="134" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

from firm to firm, but you can assume that as the capital under man-
agement increases, so do the fees and, as a result, the salaries of some
of the managing directors.

The venture capital firm gets this management fee completely
independently of its investing success. Over the long term, the only
consequence of investment success on the fee is the ability of the
firm to raise additional funds. If the firm does not generate mean-
ingful positive returns, over time it will have difficulty raising addi-
tional funds. However, this isn't an overnight phenomenon, as the
fee arrangements for each fund are guaranteed for 10 years. We've
been known to say that "it takes a decade to kill a venture capital
firm," and the extended fee dynamic is a key part of this.


### Carried Interest

Even though the management fees can be substantial, in a success
case the real money that a VC makes, known as the carried interest,
or carry, should dwarf the management fee. Carry is the profit that
VCs get after returning money to their investors (the LPs). If we use
our $100 million fund example, VCs receive their carry after they've
returned $100 million to their LPs. Most VCs get 20% of the profits
after returning capital (a 20% carry), although some long-standing
or extremely successful funds take up to 30% of the profits.

Let's play out our example. Again, start with the $100 million
fund. Assume that it's a successful fund and returns 3x the capital, or
$300 million. In this case, the first $100 million goes back to the LPs,
and the remaining profit, or $200 million, is split 80% to the LPs and
20% to the GPs. The venture capital firm gets $40 million in carried
interest and the LPs get the remaining $160 million. And yes, in this
case everyone is very happy.

Remember that this firm received about $15 million of manage-
ment fees over a decade for this fund. However, there's an interesting
nuance here. If the fund is a $100 million fund and $15 million goes
to management fees, doesn't that leave only $85 million to invest? In
some cases it does, but VCs are allowed to recycle their management
fee and subsequently reinvest it up to the total of $100 million. This
assumes returns early enough in the life of the fund to recycle and
in some cases careful cash flow management, but all firms should be
motivated to get the entire $100 million to work. In this case, the
$15 million management fee can actually be viewed as a prepayment

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="135" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

on carry since it is essentially getting reinvested from proceeds from
the fund. All LPs should favor recycling, as their goal is generally
cash-on-cash return. Getting more money to work, namely the full
$100 million instead of only $85 million, enhances the total return.

Note that we have been talking about the venture capital firm
as a whole, not any individual managing director or other invest-
ment professional in the firm. An individual VC could quadruple
the amount of money invested in his particular companies, but still
receive no carry in a fund due to poor investment decisions made by
the other partners. In addition, most firms do not have equal alloca-
tion of carry between partners, with the senior partners tending to
get disproportionately more than the younger partners. Over time
this can be a major source of friction within the firm if there is either
inequitable behavior from the senior partners or other firms offer
the young star performers better economic incentives and pick them
off. This gets especially difficult when a fund, or a series of funds, is
performing poorly yet the positive returns are coming from one or
two partners.

Those of you sophisticated in the art of fund structure will note
that we've neglected to point out that LPs want their VCs to invest in
their own fund. Historically, there has been a 99%/1% split between
the LPs and the GPs, where the VC partners put in their own money
alongside the LPs for 1% of the fund (e.g., in our $100 million fund
example, the LPs would put in $99 million and the GPs would put in
$1 million). The GP commitment historically was 1% but has floated
up over time and is occasionally as high as 5%.

While carry sounds like a wonderful thing, there is one risky situ-
ation around it called the clawback. Again, assume our $100 million
fund. Let's also assume the VCs have called only half of the fund
($50 million). If the $50 million invested so far returns $80 million,
the fund is in a profit situation where $50 million has been returned
and there is $30 million in profit that the VCs have the right to take
their carry on. The VCs happily pocket their $6 million, assuming
the carry is 20%. But what happens if the VCs call and invest the rest
of the fund and it's a bust, returning a total of only $100 million? At
the end of the fund, the VCs would have invested $100 million, but
returned only $100 million, and as a result should get no carry.

So what happens to the $6 million they took in the middle of the
fund life? The $6 million is clawed back from the VCs and given back
to the LPs. While logical in theory, it's harder in practice. Assume the

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="136" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

venture capital fund has four equal partners who have each received
a $1.5 million carry check. These were happy days, followed by some
not so happy days when the fund performed poorly. Along the way,
two of the VCs left the firm to go to other firms, and the remaining
two partners no longer talk to them. In fact, one of the remaining
partners got divorced and gave half of his money to his ex-spouse.
And one of the other VCs declared bankruptcy after overextend-
ing himself financially. Oh, and all four of them have paid taxes on
their carry.

The LPs don't care. They want the $6 million that is owed to
them, and many fund agreements state that each partner is liable for
the full amount, regardless of what they actually received in profit
distributions. So, it's possible that a subset of the partnership has to
pay back the LPs and fight with the current and former partners for
the rest. It's not pretty and we wish this were only a hypothetical situ-
ation, but it's not.


### Reimbursement for Expenses

There is one other small income stream that VCs receive: reimburse-
ments from the companies they invest in for expenses associated
with board meetings. VCs will charge all reasonable expenses associ-
ated with board meetings to the company they are visiting. This usu-
ally isn't a big deal unless your VC always flies on his private plane
and stays at the presidential suite at your local Four Seasons hotel. In
the case where you feel your VC is spending excessively and charging
everything back to the company, you should feel comfortable con-
fronting the VC. If you aren't, enlist one of your more frugal board
members to help.


## How Time Impacts Fund Activity

VC fund agreements have two concepts that govern the ability to
invest over time. The first concept is called the commitment period.
The commitment period (also called "investment period"), which is
usually five years, is the length of time that a VC has for identifying
and investing in new companies in the fund. Once the commitment
period is over, the fund can no longer invest in new companies, but
it can invest additional money in existing portfolio companies. This
is one of the main reasons that VC firms typically raise a new fund

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="137" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

every three to five years-once they've committed to all the compa-
nies they are going to invest in from a fund, they need to raise a new
fund to stay active as investors in new companies.

It's sad but true that some VCs who are past their commitment
periods and have not raised new funds still meet with entrepreneurs
trying to raise money. In these cases, the entrepreneur has no idea
that there is no chance the VCs will invest, but the VCs get to pretend
they are still actively investing and try to maintain some semblance of
deal flow even though they can't invest any longer. We first saw this
in 2006 and 2007 as firms that raised their previous funds in 2000 or
2001 struggled to raise new funds. Over time the media picked up
on this dynamic and started referring to these firms as the "walking
dead"-zombie-like VCs who were still acting like VCs, earning man-
agement fees from their old funds and actively managing their old
portfolios, but not making new investments.

The good zombies are open about their status; the not-so-good
ones keep taking meetings with new companies even though they
can't make new investments. It's usually easy to spot a zombie VC-
just ask them when they made their last new investment. If it's more
than a year ago, it's likely they are a zombie. You can also ask simple
questions like "How many new investments will you make out of your
current fund?" or "When do you expect to be raising a new fund?" If
you feel like the VC is giving you ambiguous answers, they are prob-
ably a zombie.

The other concept is called the investment term, or the length
of time that the fund can remain active. New investments can be
made only during the commitment/investment period, but follow-
on investments can be made during the investment term. A typical
VC fund has a 10-year investment term with two one-year options to
extend, although some have three one-year extensions or one two-
year extension. Twelve years may sound like plenty of time, but when
an early-stage fund makes a new seed investment in its fifth year and
the time frame for exit for an average investment can stretch out
over a decade, 12 years is often a constraint. As a result, many early-
stage funds go on for longer than 12 years-occasionally up to as
many as 17 years (or even more).

Once you get past 12 years, the LPs have to affirmatively vote
every year to have the GP continue to operate the fund. In cases in
which a firm has continued to raise additional funds, the LPs are

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="138" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

generally supportive of this continued fund extension activity. There
is often a negotiation over the management fee being charged to
continue to manage the fund, with it ranging from a lower percent-
age of remaining invested capital (say, 1%) all the way to waiving the
fee entirely. This isn't an issue for a firm that has raised additional
funds and has the management fee from those funds to cover its
operations, but it is a major issue for zombie firms that find their
annual operating fees materially declining. Time is not the friend
of a zombie firm, as partners begin to leave for greener pastures,
spend less and less time helping the companies they've invested in,
or simply start pushing the companies to sell and generate liquidity.

In some cases, entire portfolios are sold to new firms via what
is called a secondary sale in which someone else takes over manag-
ing the portfolio through the liquidation of the companies. In these
cases, the people the entrepreneurs are dealing with, including their
board members, can change completely. These secondary buyers
often have very different agendas than the original investor, usually
much more focused on driving the company to a speedy exit, even at
a lower value than the other LPs.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

One important thing to understand about your prospective investor's fund is how
old the fund is. The closer the fund is to its end of life, the more problematic
things can become for you in terms of investor pressure for liquidity (in which
your interests and the investor's might not be aligned), or an investor require-
ment to distribute shares in your company to LPs, which could be horrible for
you if the firm has a large number of LPs who then become direct shareholders.


## Reserves

Reserves are the amount of investment capital that is allocated to each
company that a VC invests in. This is a very important concept that
most entrepreneurs don't pay proper attention to. Imagine that a
VC invests $1 million in the first round of your company. When they
make the investment, the VC will reserve a theoretical future amount
of the fund to invest in follow-on rounds. The VC generally won't tell
you this amount, but it's usually a well-defined amount within the
venture capital firm.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="139" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

Typically, but not always, the earlier the stage a company is at,
the more reserves the VC will allocate. In the case of a late stage
investment immediately prior to an initial public offering (IPO), a
VC might not have any reserves allocated to a company, whereas a
first-round investment might have reserves of $10 million or more
associated with it.

While most VCs will ask the entrepreneur about future funding
needs prior to making an investment, many VCs ignore this number
and come up with their own views of the future financing dynamics
and the corresponding reserves amount. In our experience, entre-
preneurs are often optimistic about how much capital they need,
estimating on the low side. VCs will rely on their own experience
when figuring out reserves and will often be conservative and esti-
mate high early in the life of the investment, reducing this number
over time as a company ages.

Let's look at how reserve analysis can impact a company. Assume
a venture capital firm has a $100 million fund and invests a total of
$50 million into 10 different companies. Assume also that the ven-
ture capital firm has an aggregate of $50 million in reserves divided
between the 10 companies. While it doesn't matter if the firm is
accurately reserved on a company by company basis at the begin-
ning, the total amount reserved and how it is deployed over time are
critical. If the VC has underreserved and $70 million ends up being
needed in aggregate to support the ongoing funding of the 10 com-
panies, the VC firm won't have the ability to continue to fund all of
the companies it is an investor in. This usually results in VCs picking
favorites and not supporting some of the companies. Although this
can manifest itself as VCs simply walking away from their investments
or being direct that they have no additional money to invest, the
behavior by the VC is usually more mysterious. The less upfront VC
will often actively resist additional financings, try to limit the size and
subsequently the dilution of these financings, or push you to sell the
company. In cases where a pay-to-play term is in effect, you'll often
see more resistance to additional financings as the venture capital
firm tries to protect its position in the company, even if it's not neces-
sarily the right thing to do for the business.

Overreserving, or reserving $50 million when you ultimately
need only $30 million, is also an issue, but it doesn't impact the entre-
preneurs. Overreserving results in the VC underinvesting the fund,
which is economically disadvantageous to the LPs and the VCs. The

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="140" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

LPs want all of the fund capital to be invested because it increases
the chance of returning more capital. The VCs also want to get all
the money to work, especially when funds become profitable, as the
greater the absolute return, the greater the carry.

Most venture capital fund agreements allow a firm to raise a new
fund once they are around 70% committed and reserved. While this
threshold varies by firms, it is usually reasonably high. As a result,
there is a slight motivation to overreserve to reach this threshold
that is countered by the negative economic dynamics of not fully
investing the fund. Of course, independent of the threshold, the VC
still needs to have good performance and the support of the existing
investors to raise a new fund.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

You should understand how much capital the firm reserves for follow-on invest-
ments per company, or in the case of your company in particular. If you think
your company is likely to need multiple rounds of financing, you want to make
sure the VC has plenty of "dry powder" in reserve for your company so you don't
end up in contentious situations down the road in which your investor has no
more money left to invest and is then at odds with you or with future investors.


## Cash Flow

VCs have to pay as much attention to cash flow as entrepreneurs do,
although many don't until they run into trouble. Remember that the
capital raised by a venture firm can be used for investments in com-
panies, management fees, and expenses of the fund, which include
paying accountants for an annual audit and tax filings and paying
lawyers for any litigation issues. Also remember that LPs want their
VCs to invest 100% of the fund in companies.

If a VC has a $100 million fund with a typical management fee,
approximately $15 million will be spent on noninvesting activity
during the life of the fund. This means to fully invest the $100 mil-
lion, the fund will need to generate $15 million of returns that it can
recycle-or invest-over the life of the fund. More important is that
timing matters since the exits that generate this additional cash are
unpredictable, and as a fund gets later in its life, it can start to get
into a position where it doesn't actually have the cash to recycle.

In the most extreme case, the firm will underreserve and not
manage cash flow effectively. As a result, it will find itself crunched

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="141" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

at both ends. It won't have adequate reserves to continue to support
its investments and, even if it did, it won't have the cash to pay its
employees through management fees. This situation can occur even
in firms that have raised follow-on funds, as the cash flow dynamics
of recycling are fund specific.


## Cross-Fund Investing

Many venture capital firms invest out of several linked fund entities
(e.g., you may have two funds as investors in your fund-VC Fund III
and VC Entrepreneurs Fund III); however, there are also cases where
firms will fund out of two completely separate funds, say VC Fund III
and VC Fund IV. These are called cross-fund investments. Typically, you'll
see this when the first fund (Fund III) is underreserved and the second
fund (Fund IV) fills in the gap to help the venture capital firm as a
whole protect its position and provide support for the company.

Cross-fund investing can lead to several problems between the
venture capital firm and its LPs. Cross-fund investing is rarely done
from the beginning of an investment, so the later rounds are done at
a different price (not always higher) than the earlier rounds. Since
the underlying funds almost always have different LP composition
and each fund will end up with a different return profile on the
exit, the LPs won't be treated economically equally across the invest-
ment. In the upside case where the valuation is steadily increasing,
this won't matter, as everyone will be happy with the positive eco-
nomic outcome. However, in the downside case, or an upside case
where the round that the second fund invests in is a down round,
this is a no-win situation for the VC. In this situation, one fund will
be disadvantaged over the other and some LPs will end up in a worse
situation than they would have been in if the cross-fund investment
hadn't happened. And if our friendly VC thinks too hard, the eco-
nomic conflict will start to melt his brain.

The one exception is when an early-stage firm creates a growth
fund to invest in their successful companies. These funds are often
called Opportunity or Select funds and are a logical way for early-
stage investors to participate in their winners at later stages.


## Departing Partners

Most venture capital firms have a key man clause that defines what
happens in the case in which a certain number of partners or a spe-
cific partner leaves the firm. In some cases, when a firm trips the key

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="142" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

man clause, the LPs have the right to suspend the ability of the fund
to make new investments or can even shut down the fund. In cases
where a partner leaves the firm but doesn't trip the key man clause,
there are often contentious issues over firm economics, especially if
the firm has been poorly structured, doesn't have appropriate vest-
ing, or has a significant amount of economics in the hands of the
departing partner, leaving the other partners with insignificant moti-
vation (at least in their minds) for continuing to actively manage
the firm. While the entrepreneur can't impact this, it's important to
be sensitive to any potential dynamics in the structure of the firm,
especially if the departing partner is the one who sits on your board
or has sponsored the investment in your company.


## Corporate Venture Capital

In the past few years we have seen the emergence of numerous cor-
porate venture capital (CVC) groups. These are VCs who have a
large corporation behind them, and are usually easy to identify since
they go by names like Google Ventures (now GV), Intel Ventures,
Qualcomm Ventures, Salesforce Ventures, and Microsoft Ventures.
Today, there are several hundred CVCs. As with traditional venture
capital firms, they vary greatly in size, shape, strategy, and incentives.

CVC, however, is not a new phenomenon, as it has been around
for decades. There was a huge increase in the number of CVCs in
the late 1990s leading up to the peak of the Internet bubble, with a
correspondingly rapid evaporation of these firms after the Internet
bubble burst. Over the past decade they've began to emerge again,
with a recent, rapid increase in the number of firms.

Unlike a traditional VC that reports to its limited partners, CVCs
may answer to executive management teams, other company depart-
ments, public shareholders, or even quarterly results. While some
CVCs are indistinguishable from traditional VCs, many CVCs invest
off of their companies' balance sheets and as a result don't have sep-
arate fund structures. When the CVC is not a separate entity, but one
that reports up to the CEO or other executive (sometimes the chief
financial officer [CFO]) of a large public company, many different
pressures come into play beside a direct focus on financial returns.
Availability of capital to invest shifts with changes in a company's
stock price and balance sheet, which can have significant impact on
a startup's ability to raise additional capital from the CVC.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="143" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

Teams at CVCs often experience employee turnover, especially
if the CVC has star performers who are incented with equity in their
public company rather than economics associated with their invest-
ment returns. These CVC partners are easy pickings for many tradi-
tional venture capital firms who are looking to grow as compensa-
tion, autonomy, and authority is often significantly higher in venture
capital firms than in CVCs.

Motivations around valuation, structure, and control in subse-
quent financings or merger and acquisition (M&A) activity is often
different between VCs and CVCs. In addition to how a typical VC
is motivated, CVCs often, but not always, have other interests in
becoming investors in your company including insight into your
technology, partnering around a distribution channel or go to mar-
ket approach, or locking out a competitor. As a result, CVCs are
often willing to pay a higher valuation than VCs given these addi-
tional motivations. At the same time, CVCs often look for more
control, such as a first right of refusal on an acquisition (something
you should never, ever give). While the higher valuation might feel
good, realize that if it's too high it may negatively impact your next
round of financing.

Some CVCs will take board seats, but many do not require
anything beyond observer roles on the boards. Lawyers at a CVC
parent company are often concerned about potential conflicts of
interest that might arise along with issues around information pro-
perty linkage.

Compensation varies widely between CVCs and often differs sig-
nificantly from the management fee/ carried interest approach of VC
firms. Many CVCs are simply employees of their parent companies
with salary, bonus, and stock option pay packages. In some cases, the
CVC has a bonus plan tied to company performance, but it's rarely
equivalent to the economics of a traditional VC firm.

Finally, be mindful of potential conflicts, especially around tech-
nology and customers. As one of the motivations for a CVCs is to have
insight and/ or access to innovative companies and their products, they
often are investing in companies they think can become large, long-
term users of the CVC's parent company technology and products.
While this can be powerful, consider what happens to the relationship
when you decide to use a competitor's technology over that of your
CVC or when one day you wake up and realize that the CVC's parent
company has come out with a product that competes with yours.

## Strategic Investors

While many CVCs also consider themselves strategic investors, there
are many strategic investors that aren't formalized as venture capital
investors. These are companies that aren't in the business of making
venture capital investments, but for a particular reason want to invest
in your company. For instance, suppose you produce a consumer
device in China and your contract manufacturer tells you they want
to invest in your company. While flattering, there are both positive
and negative aspects to this.

As with CVCs, strategic investors are incentivized differently,
have different masters to answer to, and have varying motivations for
their investments beyond overall returns.

Suppose you are the founder of a company called SwearJar.com,
which makes a wearable device that detects foul language uttered by
the wearer. Upon such detection, it automatically debits your bank
account and sends 80% of the proceeds to charity and 20% to Swear-
Jar (yup, we've seen this, and are a particularly good customer target).
Your product is manufactured at ChinaFab, Inc. and they've offered
to invest $1 million in your company. They have indicated that they
don't care about the valuation and are happy to participate at what-
ever your last round was priced at. You need the money, would love
to be more tightly connected to your manufacturing partner, and
are inclined to take it.

Before you get too excited, consider what will happen to their
service to you as your manufacturer. If they have experience mak-
ing strategic investments, explore whether things have gotten better
or worse after they made this strategic investment. In addition to
seeing some strategic investors start taking companies like SwearJar
for granted after they've invested, people in the strategic partner
organization begin to justify their performance as a result of hav-
ing an investment in the company. Now, you want to hold them
accountable by spinning up a competitive process for another con-
tract manufacturer. At best, this is awkward and often can negatively
impact your business relationship. But, your strategic investor will
still be an equity owner of your company, making things even more
complicated.

Often, the strategic investor will be helpful and the relationship
will be a constructive one. For confident strategic investors, they often

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="145" -->
<!-- PageHeader="How Venture Capital Funds Work" -->

ask for additional equity consideration for helping your company
succeed. While this ignores the fact that your VC investors aren't get-
ting additional equity compensation for helping you, strategic inves-
tors often feel entitled to something. In these cases, we encourage
you to use a performance warrant.

As with a regular warrant, a performance warrant is an option for
the strategic partner to buy stock in your company (usually common
stock) at a set price (often the most recent financing round price).
Unlike a regular warrant, the performance warrant is issued only
when the strategic investor accomplishes predetermined perfor-
mance goals. In this situation, if they perform, you reward them with
the performance warrant. If they don't perform, they still received
their equity in exchange for their investment, but they didn't get the
extra equity they were looking for.


## Fiduciary Duties

VCs owe fiduciary duties, concurrently and on the same importance
level, to their management company, to the GP, to the LP, and to
each board that they serve on. If your investor is a CVC or strategic
investor, they will owe a fiduciary duty back to their parent organiza-
tion. Normally, this all works out fine if one is dealing with a credible
and legitimate firm, but even in the best of cases, these duties can
conflict with one another and both VCs and CVCs can find them-
selves in a fiduciary sandwich.

For the entrepreneur, it's important to remember that no mat-
ter how much you love your investors, they answer to other people
and have a complex set of formal, legal responsibilities. Some inves-
tors understand this well, are transparent, and have a clearly defined
set of internal guidelines when they find themselves in the midst of
fiduciary conflicts. Others don't and subsequently act in confusing,
complicated, and occasionally difficult ways.

More annoyingly to those of us who understand this dynamic,
some investors pontificate about their fiduciary duties while not
really knowing what to do. If you ever feel uncomfortable with the
dynamic, remember that your legal counsel represents your com-
pany and can help you cut through the noise to understand what is
really going on.

## Implications for the Entrepreneur

VCs' motivations and financial incentives will show up in many ways
that may affect their judgment or impact them emotionally, espe-
cially in times of difficult or pivotal decisions for a company. Don't
be blind to the issues that affect your investment partners. More
importantly, don't be afraid to discuss these issues with them; an
uncomfortable yet open discussion today could save you the trauma
of a surprise and company-impacting interaction later.

## Negotiation Tactics

R
egardless of how much you know about term sheets, you still
need to be able to negotiate a good deal. We've found that most
people, including many lawyers, are weak negotiators. Fortunately
for our current and future portfolio company executives, they can
read about everything we know online and in this book, so hopefully
in addition to being better negotiators, they now know all of our
moves and can negotiate more effectively against us.

There are plenty of treatises on negotiations; however, this chap-
ter walks through some negotiation tactics that have worked well for
us over the years. Although this book is primarily about financings,
we'll talk about a range of negotiation tactics that you can use in
your life, and we illustrate some of the different types of characters
you'll probably meet along the way.


### What Really Matters?

There are only three things that matter when negotiating a financ-
ing: achieving a good and fair result, not killing your personal rela-
tionship getting there, and understanding the deal that you are
striking.

It has been said that a good deal means neither party is happy.
This might be true in litigation or acquisitions, but if neither party is
happy following the closing of a venture financing, then you have a
real problem. Remember, the financing is only the beginning of the
relationship and a small part at that. Building the company together

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="147" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="148" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

while having a productive and good relationship is what matters. A
great starting point is for both sides to think they have achieved a fair
result and feel lucky to be in business with one another. If you behave
poorly during the financing, it's likely that tensions will be strained for
some time if the deal actually gets closed. And if your lawyer behaved
badly during the negotiation, it's likely that lawyer will be looking for a
new client after the venture capitalist (VC) joins the board.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Your lawyer shouldn't be a jerk in manner or unreasonable in positions, but this
doesn't mean you should advise your lawyer to behave in a milquetoast manner
during negotiations, especially if he is well versed in venture financings. You
need to manage this carefully as the entrepreneur, even if your eyes glaze over
at legalese. This is your company and your deal, not your lawyer's.

As for which deal terms matter, we've talked previously about
economics and control. We'd suggest that any significant time you
are spending negotiating beyond these two core concepts is a waste
of time. You can learn a lot about the person you are negotiating
with by what that individual focuses on.

Pick a few things that really matter-the valuation, stock option
pool, liquidation preferences, board, and voting controls-and be
done with it. The cliché "you never make money on terms" is espe-
cially true outside of a few key ones that we've dwelled on already.
The good karma that will attach to you from the other side (assum-
ing they aren't jerks) will be well worth it.


### Preparing for the Negotiation

The single biggest mistake people make during negotiation is a lack
of preparation. It's incredible to us that people will walk blindly into
a negotiation when so much is on the line. And this isn't just about
venture deals, as we've seen this behavior in all types of negotiations.

Many people don't prepare because they feel they don't know
what they should prepare for. We'll give you some ideas, but realize
that you probably do know how to negotiate better than you think.
You already negotiate many times a day during your interactions in
life, but most people generally just do it and don't think too hard
about it. If you have a spouse, child, auto mechanic, domesticated

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="149" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

animal, or any friends, chances are that you have dozens of negotia-
tions every day.

When you are going to negotiate your financing (or anything,
really), have a plan. Have key things that you want, understand which
terms you are willing to concede, and know when you are willing to
walk away. If you try to determine this during the negotiation, your
emotions are likely to get the best of you and you'll make mistakes.
Always have a plan.

Next, spend some time beforehand getting to know whom you
are dealing with. Some people (like us) are so easy to find that you
can Google us and know just about everything we think. If we openly
state that we think people who negotiate registration rights in a term
sheets are idiots (which we do), then why on Earth would you or your
lawyer make a big deal about it? This being said, more than 50% of
the term sheet markups we get from lawyers have requested changes
to the registration rights section, which makes us instantly look down
on the lawyer and know that the entrepreneur isn't the one running
the show. (Yes, we keep a list of these law firms.)

If you get to know the other side ahead of time, you might also
be able to play to their strengths, weaknesses, biases, curiosities, and
insecurities. The saying "knowledge is power" applies here. And
remember, just because you can gain the upper hand in using this
type of knowledge doesn't mean that you have to, but it will serve as
a security blanket and might be necessary if things turn south.

One thing to remember: everyone has an advantage over every-
one else in all negotiations. There might be a David to the Goliath, but
even David knew a few things that the big man didn't. Life is the same
way. Figure out your superpower and your adversary's kryptonite.

If you are a first-time, 20-something entrepreneur negotiating a
term sheet against a 40-something, well-weathered, and experienced
VC, what possible advantage could you have on the VC? The VC
clearly understands the terms better. The VC also has a ton of market
knowledge. And let's assume that this VC is the only credible fund-
ing source that you have. Sounds pretty bleak, right?

Well, yes, but don't despair. There is one immediate advantage
that you probably have: time. If we generalize, it's easy to come up
with a scenario of the VC having a family and lots of portfolio com-
panies and investors to deal with. You, on the other hand, have one
singular focus: your company and this negotiation. You can afford to
make the process a longer one than the VC might want. In fact, most

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="150" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

experienced VCs really hate this part of the process and will bend on
terms in order to aid efficiency, although some won't and will nitpick
every point (we'll deal with those folks later). Perhaps you'll want to
set up your negotiation call at the end of the day, right before the
VC's dinner. Or maybe you'll sweetly ask your VC to explain a host of
terms that you "don't understand" and further put burdens on the
VC's time. Think this doesn't happen? After we gave this advice to
some of the Techstars (see www.techstars.com) teams in 2009, one
of the teams waited until two hours before Jason left on vacation to
negotiate the term sheet we gave them. Jason didn't even recognize
this as their strategy and figured it was bad luck with timing. As a
result, he faced time pressure that was artificially manufactured by
a 20-something first-time entrepreneur. Nice job, Alex. (Alex White,
former CEO of Next Big Sound, which was acquired by Pandora).

There are advantages all over the place. Is your VC a huge Stan-
ford fan? Chat her up and find out if she has courtside seats to the
game. Is your VC into a charity that you care about? Use this infor-
mation to connect with her so she becomes more sympathetic. While
simple things like this are endless, what matters is that you have a
plan, know the other side, and consider what natural advantages you
have. In a perfect world, you won't have to use any of these tools, but
if you need them and don't bring them to the actual negotiation, it's
your loss.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Your biggest advantage is to have a solid Plan B-lots of interest and competi-
tion for your deal. VCs will fold like a house of cards on all peripheral terms if
you have another comparable quality VC waiting in the wings to work with you.


## A Brief Introduction to Game Theory

Everyone has a natural negotiating style. These styles have analogues
that can work either well or poorly in trying to achieve a negotiated
result. It's important to understand how certain styles work well
together, how some conflict, and how some have inherent advantages
over one another.

Before we delve into that, let's spend a little time on basic game
theory. Game theory is a mathematical theory that deals with strategies

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="151" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

for maximizing gains and minimizing losses within prescribed con-
straints, such as the rules of a card game. Game theory is widely applied
in the solution of various decision-making problems, such as those of
military strategy and business policy.

Game theory states that there are rules underlying situations
that affect how these situations will be played out. These rules are
independent of the humans involved and will predict and change
how humans interact within the constructs of the situation. Knowing
what these invisible rules are is of major importance when entering
into any type of negotiation.

The most famous of all games is the prisoner's dilemma, which you've
seen many times if you've ever watched a cop show on television. The
simple form, as described in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
(http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prisoner-dilemma/#Sym2t2PDOrd
Pay), follows:

Tanya and Cinque have been arrested for robbing the Hibernia
Savings Bank and placed in separate isolation cells. Both care
much more about their personal freedom than about the wel-
fare of their accomplice. A clever prosecutor makes the follow-
ing offer to each. "You may choose to confess or remain silent.
If you confess and your accomplice remains silent, I will drop all
charges against you and use your testimony to ensure that your
accomplice does serious time. Likewise, if your accomplice con-
fesses while you remain silent, they will go free while you do the
time. If you both confess, I get two convictions, but I'll see to it
that you both get early parole. If you both remain silent, I'll have
to settle for token sentences on firearms possession charges. If
you wish to confess, you must leave a note with the jailer before
my return tomorrow morning."

The classic prisoner's dilemma can be summarized as shown in
the following table.


## Classic Prisoner's Dilemma


<table>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Prisoner B Stays Silent</th>
<th>Prisoner B Betrays</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prisoner A Stays Silent</td>
<td>Each serves 8 months</td>
<td>Prisoner A: 12 years Prisoner B: goes free</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Prisoner A Betrays</td>
<td>Prisoner A: goes free Prisoner B: 12 years</td>
<td>Each serves 5 years</td>
</tr>
</table>


<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageNumber="152" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

What's fascinating about this is that there is a fundamental rule
in this game that demonstrates why two people might not cooperate
with one another, even if it is clearly in their best interests to do so.

If the two prisoners cooperate, the outcome is best, in the aggre-
gate, for both of them. They each get eight months of jail time
and walk away. But the game forces different behavior. Regardless
of what the co-conspirator chooses (silence versus betrayal), each
player always receives a lighter sentence by betraying the other. In
other words, no matter what the other guy does, you are always bet-
ter off by ratting him out.

The other rule to this game is that it is a single-play game. In other
words, the participants play the game once and their fate is cast.
Other games are multiplay games. For instance, there is a lot of inter-
esting game theory about battlegrounds. If you are in one trench
fighting and we are in another, game theory would suggest that
we would not fight at night, on weekends, on holidays, and during
meals. Why not? It would seem logical that if we know you are sleep-
ing, it's the absolute best time to attack.

Well, it's not, unless we can completely take you out with one
strike. Otherwise, you'll most likely start attacking us during dinner,
on holidays, or while we are watching Mad Men. And then not only
are we still fighting, but now we've both lost our free time. This tit-for-
tat strategy is what keeps multiplay games at equilibrium. If you don't
mess with us during our lunch break, we won't mess with you during
yours. And everyone is better off. But if you do mess with us, we'll
continue to mess with you until you are nice to us again.

When you are considering which game you are playing, consider
not only whether there are forces at work that influence the deci-
sions being made, like the prisoner's dilemma, but also how many
times a decision will be made. Is this a one-shot deal, or will this
game repeat itself, lending increased importance to precedent and
reputation?


## Negotiating in the Game of Financings

A venture financing is one of the easiest games there is. First, you
really can have a win-win outcome where everyone is better off.
Second, you don't negotiate in a vacuum like your hypothetical
fellow criminal co-conspirator. Finally, and most important, this is
not a single instance game. Therefore, reputation and the fear of
tit-for-tat retaliation are real considerations.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="153" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

Since the VC and entrepreneur will need to spend a lot of time
together post investment, the continued relationship makes it impor-
tant to look at the financing as just one negotiation in a very long,
multiplay game. Doing anything that would give the other party an
incentive to retaliate in the future is not a wise, or rational, move.

Furthermore, for the VC, this financing is but one of many that
the VC will hope to complete. Therefore, the VC should be thinking
about reputational factors that extend well beyond this particular
interaction. With the maturation of the venture capital industry, it's
easy to get near-perfect information on most VCs. Having a negative
reputation can be fatal to a VC in the long run.

Not all VCs recognize that each negotiation isn't a single-round,
winner-take-all game. Generally, the more experience VCs have, the
better their perspective is, but this lack of a longer-term view is not
limited to junior VCs. While we'll often see this behavior more from
the lawyers representing the VCs or the entrepreneurs, we also see it
from the business principals. When we run across people like this, at
a minimum we lose a lot of respect for them and occasionally decide
not to do business with them. When you encounter VCs who either
have a reputation for or are acting as though every negotiation is a
single-round, winner-take-all game, you should be very cautious.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

One successful negotiating tactic is to ask VCs up front, before the term sheet
shows up, what the three most important terms are in a financing for them. You
should know and be prepared to articulate your top three wants as well. This
conversation can set the stage for how you think about negotiating down the
road, and it can be helpful to you when you are in the heat of a negotiation. If
the VCs are pounding hard on a point that is not one of their stated top three,
it's much easier to call them out on that fact and note that they are getting most
or all of their main points.

Game theory is also useful because of the other types of negotia-
tions you'll have. For instance, if you decide to sell your company,
your acquisition discussions can be similar to the prisoner's dilemma
as presented earlier. Customer negotiations usually take on the feel-
ing of a single-round game, despite any thoughts to the contrary
about partnerships. And litigation almost always takes the form of a
single-round game, even when the parties will have ongoing relation-
ships beyond the resolution of the litigation.

Remember, you can't change the game you are in, but you can
judge people who play poorly within it. And having a game theory
lens to view the other side is very useful.


### Negotiating Styles and Approaches

Every person has a natural negotiating style that is often the part
of your personality that you adopt when you are dealing with con-
flict. Few people have truly different modes for negotiation, but that
doesn't mean you can't practice having a range of different behav-
iors that depend on the situation you are in.

Most good negotiators know where they are comfortable, but
also know how to play upon and against other people's natural styles.
Following are some of the personalities you'll meet and how you
might want to best work with them.


#### The Bully (aka UAW Negotiator)

The bully negotiates by yelling and screaming, forcing issues, and
threatening the other party. Most folks who are bullies aren't that
smart and don't really understand the issues; rather, they try to win
by force. There are two ways to deal with bullies: punch them in the
nose or mellow out so much that you sap their strength. If you can
outbully the bully, go for it. But if you are wrong, then you've prob-
ably ignited a volcano. Unlike the children's playground, getting hit
by a bully during a negotiation generally doesn't hurt; so unless this
is your natural negotiating style, our advice is to chill out as your
adversary gets hotter.


#### The Nice Guy (aka Used-Car Salesman)

Whenever you interact with this pleasant person, you feel like he's
trying to sell you something. Often, you aren't sure that you want
what he's selling. When you say no, the nice guy will either be openly
disappointed or will keep on smiling at you just like the audience
at a Tony Robbins event. In their world, life is great as long as you
acquiesce to their terms (or buy this clean 2006 Chrysler Sebring).
As the negotiation unfolds, the nice guy is increasingly hard to pin
down on anything. While the car salesman always needs to go talk
to his manager, the nice-guy negotiator regularly responds with "Let
me consider that and get back to you." While the nice guy doesn't

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="155" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

yell at you like the bully, it's often frustrating that you can never get
a real answer or seemingly make progress. Our advice is to be clear
and direct and don't get worn down, as the nice guys will happily talk
to you all day. If all else fails, don't be afraid to toss a little bully into
the mix on your side to move things forward.


#### The Technocrat (aka Pocket Protector Guy)

This is the technical nerd guy. Although he won't yell at you like the
bully and you don't wonder if there is a real human being behind
the facade like you do with the nice guy, you will feel like you are
in endless detail hell. The technocrat has a billion issues and has
a hard time deciding what's really important, since to him every-
thing is important for some reason. Our advice is to grin and bear it
and perhaps play Pokémon GO while you are listening to the other
side drone on. Technocrats tend to cause you to lose your focus dur-
ing the negotiation. Make sure you don't by remembering what you
care about and conceding the other points. But make sure you cover
all the points together, as the technocrat will often negotiate every
point from scratch, not taking into consideration the give-and-take
of each side during the negotiation.


#### The Wimp (aka George McFly)

The wimp may sound like the perfect dance partner here, but he
has his own issues. Our bet is that you can take his wallet pretty easily
during the negotiation, but if you get too good a deal it will come
back to haunt you. And then you get to live with him on your board
of directors once you close your financing. With the wimp, you end
up negotiating both sides of the deal. Sometimes this is harder than
having a real adversary.


#### The Curmudgeon (aka Archie Bunker)

With the curmudgeon, everything you negotiate sucks. No matter
what you arrive at is horrible, and every step along the way during
the negotiation will feel like a dentist tugging on a tight molar at the
back of your mouth. Unlike the bully, the curmudgeon won't yell;
and unlike the nice guy, she's never happy. While it'll seem like she
doesn't care too much about the details, she's just never happy with
any position you are taking. The curmudgeon is also not a wimp;

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="156" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

she's been around the block before and will remind you of that every
chance she gets. In a lot of ways, the curmudgeon is like a cranky
grandmother. If you are patient, upbeat, and tolerant, you'll even-
tually get what you want, but you'll never really please her because
everyone pisses her off.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

You learn a lot about a person in a negotiation. This is one argument for doing
as much of the detailed negotiation before signing a term sheet that includes
a no-shop clause in it. If you find that your potential investor is a jerk to you in
negotiating your deal, you may want to think twice about this person becoming
a board member and member of your inner circle.


### Always Be Transparent

What about the normal dude? You know, the transparent, nice,
smart, levelheaded person you hope to meet on the other side of the
table? Though they exist, everyone has some inherent styles that will
find their way into the negotiation, especially if pressed or negotia-
tions aren't going well. Make sure you know which styles you have so
you won't surprise yourself with a sudden outburst. You'll also see a
lot of these behaviors come out real-time in board meetings when
things aren't going quite as well as hoped.

If you are capable of having multiple negotiating personalities,
which should you favor? We'd argue that in a negotiation that has
reputational and relationship value, try to be the most transparent
and easygoing that you can be, to let the other person inside your
thinking and get to know you for who you really are. If you are play-
ing a single-round game, like an acquisition negotiation with a party
you don't ever expect to do business with again, do like Al Davis says:
"Just win, baby." As in sports, don't ever forget that a good tactic is to
change your game plan suddenly to keep the other side on their toes.


### Collaborative Negotiation versus Walk-Away Threats

Of all the questions we get regarding negotiations, the most com-
mon is when to walk away from a deal. Most people's blood pressure
ticks up a few points with the thought of walking away, especially

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="157" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

after you've invested a lot of time and energy (especially emotional
energy) in a negotiation. In considering whether to walk away from
a negotiation, preparation is key here-know what your walk-away
point is before starting the negotiation so it's a rational and deliber-
ate decision rather than an emotional one made in the heat of the
moment.

When determining your walk-away position, consider your best
alternative to negotiated agreement, also known in business school circles
as BATNA. Specifically, what is your backup plan if you aren't success-
ful reaching an agreement? The answer to this varies wildly depend-
ing on the circumstances. In a financing, if you are lucky, your
backup plan may be accepting your second-favorite term sheet from
another VC. It could mean bootstrapping your company and forgo-
ing a financing. Understanding BATNA is important in any negotia-
tion, such as an acquisition (walk away as a stand-alone company),
litigation (settle versus go to court), and customer contract (walk
away rather than get stuck in a bad deal).

Before you begin any negotiation, make sure you know where
your overall limits are, as well as your limits on each key point. If
you've thought this through in advance, you'll know when someone
is trying to move you past one of these boundaries. It's also usually
obvious when someone tries to pretend they are at a boundary when
they really aren't. Few people are able to feign true conviction.

At some point in some negotiation, you'll find yourself up
against the wall or being pushed into a zone that is beyond where
you are willing to go. In this situation, tell the other party there is
no deal, and walk away. As you walk away, be very clear with what
your walk-away point is so the other party will be able to reconsider
their position. If you are sincere in walking away and the other party
is interested enough in a deal, they'll likely be back at the table at
some point and will offer you something that you can stomach. If
they don't reengage, the deal wasn't meant to be.

Depending on the type of person you are negotiating with, the
VC either will be sensitive to your boundaries or will force you out-
side these boundaries, where BATNA will come into effect. If this is
happening regularly during your financing negotiation, think hard
about whether this is a VC that you want to be working with, as this
VC is likely playing a single-round game in a relationship that will
have many rounds and lots of ups and downs along the way.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="158" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Finally, don't ever make a threat during a negotiation that you
aren't willing to back up. If you bluff and aren't willing to back up
your position, your bargaining position is forever lost in this negotia-
tion. The 17th time we hear "and that's our final offer," we know that
there's another, better offer coming if we just hold out for number 18.


### Building Leverage and Getting to Yes

Besides understanding the issues and knowing how to deal with the
other party, there are certain things that you can do to increase your
negotiation leverage. In a VC financing, the best way to gain leverage
is to have competing term sheets from different VCs.

If you happen to be lucky enough to have several interested par-
ties, this will be the single biggest advantage in getting good deal
terms. However, it's a tricky balance dealing with multiple parties at
the same time. You have to worry about issues of transparency and
timing and, if you play them incorrectly, you might find yourself in a
situation where no one wants to work with you.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As I mentioned earlier, having a solid Plan B (and a Plan C, and a Plan D . . . ) is
one of your most effective weapons during the negotiation process. It's helpful to
be reasonably transparent about that fact to all prospective investors. While it's
a good practice to withhold some information, such as the names of the other
potential investors with whom you're speaking since there is no reason to enable
two VCs to talk about your deal behind your back, telling investors that you have
legitimate interest from other firms will serve you very well in terms of speeding
the process along and improving your end result.

For starters, pay attention to timing. You'll want to try to drive
each VC to deliver a term sheet to you in roughly the same time
frame. This pacing can be challenging since there will be uncomfort-
able days when you'll end up slow rolling one party while you seek to
speed up the process of another firm. This is hard to do, but if you
can get VCs to approve a financing around the same time, you're in a
much stronger position than if you have one term sheet in hand that
you are trying to use to generate additional term sheets.

Once you've received a term sheet from a VC, you can use this
to motivate action from other VCs, but you have to walk a fine
line between oversharing and being too secretive. We prefer when

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="159" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

entrepreneurs are up front, tell us that they have other interests,
and let us know where in the process they are. We never ask to
see other term sheets, and we'd recommend that you don't ever
show your actual term sheets to other investors. More important,
you should never disclose whom you are talking to, as one of the
first emails most interested VCs will send after hearing about other
VCs who are interested in a deal is something like "Hey, I hear you
are interested in investing in X-want to share notes?" As a result,
you probably no longer have a competitive situation between the
two VCs, as they will now talk about your deal and in many cases
talk about teaming up. The exception, of course, is when you want
them to team up and join together in a syndicate.

At the end of the day, if you have multiple term sheets, most of
the deal terms will collapse into the same range (usually entrepreneur
favorable), and the only real things you'll be negotiating are valuation
and board control. You can signal quite effectively what your other
options might be. Whatever you do, don't sign a term sheet and then
pull a Brett Favre and change your mind the next day. The startup
ecosystem is small, and word travels fast. Reputation is important.

Another strategy that can help you build leverage is to anchor
on certain terms. Anchoring means to pick a few points, state clearly
what you want, and then stick to your guns. If you anchor on positions
that are reasonable while still having a little flexibility to give in the
negotiation, you will likely get close to what you want as long as you
are willing to trade away other points that aren't as important to you.

Although you should try to pace the negotiation, you should do
this only after the VC has offered up the first term sheet. Never provide
a term sheet to a VC, especially with a price attached, since if you do
you've just capped what you can expect to get in the deal. You are always
in a stronger position to react to what the VC offers, especially when you
have multiple options. However, once you've gotten a term sheet,
you should work hard to control the pace of the ensuing negotiation.

As with any type of negotiation, it helps to feed the ego of your
partner. Figure out what the other side wants to hear and try to
please them. People tend to reciprocate niceties. For example, if you
are dealing with technocrats, engage them in depth on some of the
deal points, even if the points don't matter to you, in order to make
them happy and help them feel like you are playing their game.

When you are leading the negotiation, we highly recommend
that you have a strategy about the order in which you will address

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="160" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

the points. Your options are to address them either in the order that
they are laid out in the term sheet or in some other random order of
your choosing. In general, once you are a skilled negotiator, going
in order is more effective, as you won't reveal which points matter
most to you. Often, experienced negotiators will try to get agree-
ment on a point-by-point basis in order to prevent the other party
from looking holistically at the process and determining whether a
fair deal is being achieved. This strategy really works only if you have
a lot of experience, and it can really backfire on you if the other party
is more experienced and takes control of the discussion. Instead of
being on the giving end of a divide-and-conquer strategy, you'll be
on the receiving end of death by a thousand cuts.

Unless you are a very experienced negotiator, we suggest an order
where you start with some important points that you think you can
get to yes quickly. This way, both parties will feel good that they are
making progress toward a deal. Maybe it's liquidation preferences
or the stock option plan allocation. Then dive into the minutiae.
Valuation is probably the last subject to address, as you'll most likely
get closure on other terms but have a couple of different rounds of
discussion on valuation. It is completely normal for some terms to
drag out longer than others.


### Things Not to Do

There are a few things that you'll never want to do when negotiat-
ing a financing for your company. As we stated earlier, don't present
your term sheet to a VC. In addition to signaling inexperience, you
get no benefit by playing your hand first since you have no idea what
the VC will offer you. The likely result is either you'll end up starting
in a worse place than the VC would have offered, or you'll put silly
terms out there that will make you look like a rookie. If your poten-
tial funding partner tells you to propose the terms, be wary, as it's an
indication that you are talking to either someone who isn't a profes-
sional VC or someone who is professionally lazy.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

You should never make an offer first. There's no reason to, unless you have
another concrete one on the table. Why run the risk of aiming too low?

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="161" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

Next, make sure you know when to talk and when to listen. If you
remember nothing else about this section, remember this: you can't
lose a deal point if you don't open your mouth. Listening gives you
further information about the other party, including what advan-
tages you have over them (e.g., do they have a Little League baseball
game to coach in an hour?) and which negotiation styles they are
most comfortable with.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As the old cliché goes, there's a reason you have two ears and one mouth. When
you are negotiating, try to listen more than you talk, especially at the beginning
of the negotiation.

If the other party is controlling the negotiation, don't address
deal points in order of the legal paper. This is true of all negotiations,
not just financings. If you allow a person to address each point and
try to get to closure before moving on to the next point, you will lose
sight of the deal as a whole. While you might feel that the resolution
on each point is reasonable, when you reflect on the entire deal you
may be unhappy. If a party forces you into this mode, don't concede
points. Listen and let the other party know that you'll consider their
position after you hear all of their comments to the document. Many
lawyers are trained to do exactly this-to kill you softly point by point.

A lot of people rely on the same arguments over and over again
when negotiating. People who negotiate regularly, including many
VCs and lawyers, try to convince the other side to acquiesce by stat-
ing, "That's the way it is because it's market." We love hearing the
market argument because then we know that our negotiating part-
ner is a weak negotiator. Saying that "it's market" is like your parents
telling you, "Because I said so," and you responding, "But everyone's
doing it." These are elementary negotiating tactics that should have
ended around the time you left for college.

In the world of financings, you'll hear this all the time. Rather
than getting frustrated, recognize that it's not a compelling argu-
ment since the concept of market terms isn't the sole justification for
a negotiation position. Instead, probe on why the market condition
applies to you. In many cases, the other party won't be able to justify
it and, if they can't make the argument, you'll immediately have the
higher ground.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageNumber="162" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Understanding market terms and whether they apply to your situation is impor-
tant. You can quickly get context on this by talking to other entrepreneurs in
similar positions. Remember, you do only a few of these deals in your lifetime,
and your VC does them for a living. Understand what market really is, and you'll
be able to respond to an assertion that something is market with fact rather than
with emotion.

Finally, never assume that the other side has the same ethical
code as you. This isn't a comment against VCs or lawyers; rather, it's
a comment about life and pertains to every type of negotiation you'll
find yourself involved in. Everyone has a different acceptable ethical
code, and it can change depending on the context of the negotia-
tions. For instance, if you were to lie about the current state of a key
customer to a prospective VC and it was discovered before the deal
closed, you'd most likely find your deal blown up. Or perhaps the
deal would close, but you'd be fired afterward, and it's likely that
some of your peers would hear about it. As a result, both parties
(VC and entrepreneur) have solid motivation to behave in an ethi-
cal way during a financing. Note that this is directly in contrast to
most behavior, at least between lawyers, in a litigation context where
lies and half-truths are an acceptable part of that game. Regardless
of the specific negotiation context, make sure you know the ethical
code of the party you are negotiating against.


### Great Lawyers versus Bad Lawyers versus No Lawyers

Regardless of how much you think you know or how much you've
read, hire a great lawyer. In many cases you will be the least expe-
rienced person around the negotiating table. VCs negotiate for a
living, and a great lawyer on your side will help balance things out.
When choosing a lawyer, make sure she not only understands the
deal mechanics, but also has a style that you like working with and
that you are comfortable sitting alongside of. This last point can't be
overstated-your lawyer is a reflection of you, and if you choose a
lawyer who is inexperienced, is ineffective, or behaves inconsistently,
it will reflect poorly on you and decrease your negotiating credibility.

So choose a great lawyer, but make sure you know what great
means. Ask multiple entrepreneurs you respect whom they use. Check

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="163" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Negotiation Tactics" -->

around your local entrepreneurial community for the lawyers with the
best reputations. Don't limit your exploration to billing rates, respon-
siveness, and intellect, but also check style and how contentious nego-
tiations were resolved. Furthermore, it's completely acceptable to
ask your VC before and after the funding what the VC's thoughts are
about your lawyer.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Choosing a great lawyer doesn't mean hiring an expensive lawyer from a firm
that your VC knows or recommends. Often for startups, going to a top-tier law
firm means dealing with a second-tier or very junior lawyer, not well supervised,
with high billing rates. You can hire a smaller firm with lower rates and partner
attention just as well; but be sure to do your homework on them, make sure
they're experienced in dealing with venture financings, and get references-
even from VCs they've negotiated against in the past.


### Can You Make a Bad Deal Better?

Let's say you screw up and negotiate a bad deal. You had only one
term sheet, the VC was a combination bully and technocrat, and you
are now stuck with deal terms that you don't love. Should you spend
all of your time being depressed? Nope, there are plenty of ways to
fix things after the fact that most entrepreneurs never think about.

First of all, until an exit-either an acquisition or an IPO-many
of the terms don't matter much. But, more importantly, if you plan
to raise another round led by a new investor, you have a potential
ally at the time to clean up the things you negotiated poorly in the
first investment. The new VC will be motivated to make sure you and
your team are happy (assuming the company is performing), and if
you talk to your new potential financing partner about issues that are
troubling you, in many cases the new VC will concentrate on trying
to bring these back into balance in the new financing.

In the case where a new VC doesn't lead the next round, you still
have the option of sitting down with your current VCs after you've
had some run time together (again, assuming success). We've been
involved in numerous cases in which these were very constructive
conversations that resulted in entrepreneur-friendly modifications
to a deal.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="164 Venture Deals" -->

Finally, you can wait until the exit and deal with your issues then.
Most acquisition negotiations include a heavy focus on retention
dynamics for the management team going forward, and there are
often cases of reallocating some of the proceeds from the investors
to management. The style of your VCs will impact how this plays out.
If they are playing a single-round game with the negotiation and
they don't really care what happens after the deal closes, they will be
inflexible. However, if they want to be in a position to invest with you
again in the future, they'll take a top-down view of the situation and
be willing to work through modifications to the deal terms to reallo-
cate some consideration to management and employees, especially
in a retention situation for the acquirer.

Recognize, however, that this dynamic cuts both ways-many
acquirers take the approach that they want to recut the economics
in favor of the entrepreneur. Remember that as an entrepreneur you
signed up for the deal you currently have with your investors and you
have a corresponding responsibility to them. If you end up playing
a single-round game with your investors where you team up with the
acquirer, you run the risk of blowing up both the acquisition and
your relationship with your investors. So, be thoughtful, fair, and
open with your investors around the incentives and dynamics.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Having an open and collaborative approach with your VC in the context of an
acquisition may sound a bit like a game of chicken-but it can work. Being
clear with your investors about what is important to you and your team early in
the negotiation can help set a tone where you and your investors are working
together to reach the right deal structure, especially when the acquirer is trying
to drive a wedge between you and those investors. A negotiation in a state of
plenty is much easier than a negotiation in a state of scarcity.

In our experience, openness in these situations of both the entre-
preneur and the VC generally results in much better outcomes. It's
hard enough to engage in a negotiation, let alone one in which there
are multiple parties in a negotiation at cross-purposes (e.g., acquirer,
entrepreneur, and VC). We always encourage entrepreneurs and
their VC backers to keep focused on doing what is right for all share-
holders in the context of whatever is being offered, and as a result to
continue to constructively work through any issues, especially if one
party is uncomfortable with where they previously ended up.

## Raising Money the Right Way

W
hile most people ask themselves "What should I do?" when
seeking venture capitalist (VC) financing, there are also some things
that a person should not do. Doing any of the following at best makes
you look like a rookie (which is okay, we were all rookies once, but
you don't want to look like one) and at worst kills any chance that
you have of getting funded by the VC you just contacted. While this
chapter isn't about the best way to fundraise (there are many other
books covering that), we encourage you to avoid doing the following
when you are raising money from VCs.


### Don't Be a Machine

While you may have created the greatest technology in the world to
invest in, fundraising is ultimately about the people involved. If a VC
doesn't like you personally, they probably won't invest in you despite
your brilliant idea.

We tell entrepreneurs that we want to fall in love with them in the
style of "first date" energy. We want to feel time slip away and regret
when we must go onto our next commitment. After you leave, we want
to keep thinking about you and wondering when we'll get to meet again.

Some others call this the "beer test." If we don't want to have a
beer with you now, imagine how bad it will be when things inevita-
bly get tough later on down the road. Being from Boulder, we also
accept chai lattes or Vitaminwater as substitutes.

So, don't be a machine. Be human. Be yourself, let us get to
know you, and become inspired by you. As the average length of

<!-- PageNumber="165" -->
<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="166 Venture Deals" -->

relationship between a VC and an entrepreneur lasts longer than
the average U.S. marriage, this is a long-term commitment. It's not
just about the idea and the PowerPoint slides.


### Don't Ask for a Nondisclosure Agreement

Don't ask a VC for a nondisclosure agreement (NDA). Although most
VCs will respect how unique your idea, innovation, or company is to
you, it's likely that they've seen similar things due to the sheer num-
ber of business plans that they get. If they sign an NDA regarding
any company, they'd likely run afoul of it if they ended up funding a
company that you consider a competitor. An NDA will also prevent
a VC from talking to other VCs about your company, even ones who
might be good co-investors for your financing.

However, don't be too scared about approaching a reputable VC
with your idea without an NDA. The VC industry is small and wouldn't
last long if VCs spoke out of turn sharing people's knowledge with
one another. And don't think that VCs will steal your idea and start a
company, as reputational constraints as well as limits on a VC's time
will eliminate this risk in most cases. Though you might occasionally
run into a bad actor, do your homework and you'll generally be fine.


### Don't Email Carpet Bomb VCs

You might not know VCs personally, but the way to get to know them
is not by buying a mailing list and sending personalized spam. And
it's not good to hire an investment adviser who will do the same. VCs
know when they are getting a personal pitch versus spam, and we
don't know any VCs who react well to spam.

Spamming looks lazy. If you didn't take the time to really think
about who would be a good funding partner, what does that say
about how you run the rest of the business? If you want to contact
us, just email us, but make it personal to us. Be thoughtful, specific,
and strategic with your first communication attempt. You don't get a
second chance to make a first impression, and you are being judged
for much more than your idea and your bio.


### No Often Means No

While most VCs appreciate persistence, when they say they aren't
interested, they usually mean it. We aren't asking you to try again.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="167" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Raising Money the Right Way" -->

We might be saying no because your idea isn't personally interesting
to us, doesn't fit our current investment themes, or is something that
we think is a bad idea-or just because we are too busy. One thing
to know is that us saying no doesn't mean that your idea is stupid; it
just means it isn't for us.


### Don't Ask for a Referral If You Get a No

VCs get a lot of inbound email from entrepreneurs (and bankers
and lawyers) pitching new investments. At our firm, we try to look at
all of them and always attempt to respond within a day. We say no to
most of them, but we are happy to be on the receiving end of them
(and encourage you, dear reader, to send us email anytime).

When we say no, we try to do it quickly and clearly. We try to
give an explanation, although we don't attempt to argue or debate
our reason. We are sure that many of the things we say no to will
get funded, and some will become incredibly successful companies.
That's okay with us; even if we say no, we are still rooting for you.

However, if we say no, please don't respond and ask us to refer you
to someone. You don't really want us to do this, even if you don't real-
ize it. By referring you to someone else, at some level we are implicitly
endorsing you. At the same time, we just told you that we are not
interested in exploring funding your deal. These two constructs are
in conflict with each other. The person we refer you to will imme-
diately ask us if we are interested in funding your deal. We are now
in the weird position of implicitly endorsing you on one side, while
rejecting you on the other. This isn't necessarily comfortable for us,
and it's useless to you, as the likelihood of the person we have just
referred you to taking you seriously is very low. In fact, you'd probably
have a better shot at it if we weren't in the mix in the first place!


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

There's one exception to it not being suitable to ask for a referral. If you have a
relationship with the VC (e.g., it's not a cold request), ask why the answer is no.
If the response to that question is something about the VC firm rather than your
company (e.g., "You're too small for us," or "One of our portfolio companies
is too competitive"), then you may ask for a referral to another firm that might
be a better fit. However, be respectful here-if the VC doesn't want to make a
referral, don't push it.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="168" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Somewhere in a parallel universe, someone trained a bunch of
us (probably Networking 101 or at a Zig Ziglar seminar) to always
"ask for something" when you hear a "no" (e.g., keep the conversa-
tion going, get a referral, or try a different question). However, there
are cases where this isn't useful-to you.


### Don't Be a Solo Founder

Outside of some isolated examples, most entrepreneurs will have
little chance of raising money unless they have a team. A team can
be a team of two, but the solo entrepreneur raising money can be a
red flag.

First, no single person can do everything. We've never met any-
one who can do absolutely everything from product vision to execut-
ing on a plan, engineering development, marketing, sales, opera-
tions, and all the other random stuff starting a company entails.
There are just too many mission-critical tasks in getting a successful
company launched. You will be much happier if you have a partner
to back you up.

Second, it's not a good sign if you can't get others excited about
your plan. It's hard enough to get VCs to write checks to fund your
company; if you can't find other team members with the same pas-
sion and beliefs that you have, this is a warning sign to anyone who
might want to fund your company.

Finally, if you don't have a team, what is the VC investing in?
Often, the team executing the idea is more important than the idea
itself. Most VCs will tell you that they've made money on grade B
ideas with grade A teams but that many A ideas were left in the dust-
bin due to a substandard team.

The one exception would be a repeat entrepreneur. If the ven-
ture fund has had a good experience with an entrepreneur before
and believes they can build a solid team post funding, then the per-
son has a chance to get funded as a solo entrepreneur.


### Don't Overemphasize Patents

Don't rely on patents. We see a lot of entrepreneurs basically hinge
their entire company's worth on their patent strategy. If you are in
biotech, hardware, or medical devices, this might be entirely appro-
priate. When you are working on software, realize that patents are,
at best, defensive weapons for others coming after you. Creating a

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageNumber="169" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Raising Money the Right Way" -->

successful software business is about having a great idea and execut-
ing well, not about patents, in our opinion.

In fact, we wish that all business method and software patents
didn't exist (and make a lot of noise about this on our personal blogs
at www.jasonmendelson.com and www.feld.com), so if you think you
are winning us over for investment in a software company by relying
on your patent portfolio, you aren't. Instead, you just proved to us
that you didn't do any homework on us as investors and don't really
understand the value of patents versus a rock-star management team
and amazing software engineers going after a big idea.

## Issues at Different Financing Stages

N.
ot all financings are created equal. This is especially true when
you factor in the different stages that your company will evolve
through over its lifetime. While this book is primarily focused on
early-stage financings, and many of the issues apply to all stages,
there are some key differences. This chapter touches on a few of the
important ones.


### Seed Deals

While seed deals have the lowest legal costs and usually involve the
least contentious negotiations, they often allow for the most poten-
tial mistakes. Given how important precedent is in future financings,
if you reach a bad outcome on a specific term, you might be stuck
with it for the life of your company. Ironically, we've seen more cases
where the entrepreneur got what at the time seemed to be too good
of a deal but ultimately ended up being bad for them.

What's wrong with getting great terms? If you can't back them
up with performance when you raise your next round, you may find
yourself in a difficult position with your original investor. For exam-
ple, assume you are successful getting a valuation that is significantly
ahead of where your business currently is. If your next round isn't
at a higher valuation, you are going to be diluting your original
shareholders-the investors who took a big risk to fund you during
the seed stage. Either you'll have to make them whole or, worse,
they'll vote to block the new financing. This is especially true in cases

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="171" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="172" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

with unsophisticated seed investors who were expecting that, no
matter what, the next round price would be higher.

The number and type of investors you get involved in your early
rounds may also have a long-term impact on this. Assume that you
are raising a $1 million seed financing and that you've been success-
ful creating interest in your company. You have several offers-one
from a venture capitalist (VC) willing to invest $750,000 alongside
an AngelList syndicate that has committed the remaining $250,000.
The second is from five different venture capital firms, including two
very large ones, each of whom has committed to invest 20% of the
round. Which is likely better for you long term?

In our experience, the first deal is the better one. In this situa-
tion, you have a clear lead investor who will be committed to your
company and work hard for you. You also have some additional
angels, ideally including some well-networked and high-profile ones
who can help you. In the second scenario, which is often called a
party round, you don't have a clear lead investor. Instead, each of the
VCs has, in their mind, bought an option on your next financing.
In the worst case, no one really pays much attention to you until
you have spent most of the $1 million, at which point they evaluate
whether or not you've made progress as they consider investing in
the next round. Think of this as a complicated version of doubles
tennis where the shot from your opponent goes right down the mid-
dle of the court while you and your partner each shout out "yours."


### Early Stage

As with seed deals, precedent is important in early-stage deals. In our
experience, the terms you get in your first VC-led round will carry
over to all future financings. One item that can haunt you forever is
the liquidation preference. While it may not seem like a big deal to
agree to a participating preferred feature given that most early-stage
rounds aren't large dollar amounts, if you plan to raise larger rounds
one day, these participation features can drastically reduce return
characteristics for the common stockholders.

Another term to pay extra attention to at the early stage is the
protective provisions. You will want to try to collapse the protective
provisions so that all preferred stockholders, regardless of series, vote
together on them. If by your second round of financing you have two
separate votes, one by each class, for the protective provisions, you

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="173" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Issues at Different Financing Stages" -->

are most likely stuck with a structure that will give each series of stock
a separate vote and thus separate blocking rights. This can be a real
pain to manage when you have multiple lead investors in multiple
rounds that each have their own motivations to deal with.

This dynamic is influenced by the number of different rounds
you expect to raise. If you are likely to raise only two or three rounds,
the synchronization between rounds is less important. But if you
expect you will raise more than three rounds, getting as many of the
terms aligned across all classes of preferred will make your life a lot
simpler, and better, since you won't have endless multiparty negotia-
tions around every action that impact your preferred stockholders.
Recognize, however, that many entrepreneurs are overly optimistic
about how many funding rounds they will need.


### Mid and Late Stages

In your later rounds, board composition and voting control starts to
come into play in a significant way. The voting control issues in the
early-stage deals are amplified as you wrestle with how to keep con-
trol of your board when each lead investor per round wants a board
seat. Either you can increase your board size to seven, nine, or more
people (which usually effectively kills a well-functioning board) or,
more likely, the board will be dominated by investors. If your inves-
tors are well behaved, this might not be a problem, but you'll still be
serving a lot of food at board meetings.

There isn't necessarily a good answer here. Unless you have mas-
sive negotiating power in a super-hot company, you are likely to give
a board seat to each lead investor in each round. If you raise subse-
quent rounds, unless you've worked hard to manage this early, your
board will likely expand and in many cases the founders will lose
control of the board.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

There are ways to mitigate issues of board and voting control, such as placing
a cap (early on) on the number or percentage of directors who can be VCs as
opposed to independent directors, preemptively offering observer rights to any
director who is dethroned, or establishing an executive committee of the board
that can meet whenever and wherever you'd like without everyone else around
the table.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="174" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Valuation also starts to be a confounding factor in later-stage
rounds. While the natural instinct of any entrepreneur is to maxi-
mize valuation at each financing stage, the trade-off of a clean deal
with a lower valuation against a complicated deal, with excessive con-
trol and economic characteristics (referred to as structure), can often
make what seems like a great deal for the entrepreneur at the time
become a nightmare in the future.

Much like issues that we've seen in seed deals, there have been
some deals that have been too good and have forced the VCs to hold
out for a huge exit price. The net effect was that by raising money at
such a high valuation, the entrepreneurs forfeited the ability to sell
the company at a price they would have been happy with, because
of the inherent valuation-creation desires of the VCs who paid such
a high price. We've seen deal terms that specifically either forbid
sales below a certain value or provide for a guaranteed multiple on
a VC's investment that juices up the latest round investors return at
the expense of the earlier investors, founders, and employees. The
fascination with unicorns in the past few years has exacerbated this, as
sophisticated investors demand more structure, resulting in signifi-
cant outcome misalignment between early- and late-stage investors.

As we mentioned earlier in the book, when you get a term sheet from
an early-stage VC, it is almost always the case that they have full approval
of their firm to move forward with the investment. This is not necessar-
ily the case with later-stage investors, as they often have at least one more
approval step, which often happens after the entire deal has been nego-
tiated. We've seen multiple situations where this final approval didn't
happen, and the deal died at the very end of the process.

In this case, you sign the term sheet, shut down discussions with all
of the other investors you are talking to since you have signed a term
sheet with a no-shop clause, and start down the process of diligence with
your prospective investor. Along the way, they inform you that they'll
need approval from their investment committee and for some reason it
doesn't happen. At this point you are stuck. You terminated your other
investment options and now don't have a valid term sheet any more.

Sometimes the investor will attempt to renegotiate the price or
other terms knowing that they have all the leverage. We personally
find this deplorable, and it was one of the motivations for us to raise
our Foundry Select fund, as we were tired of later-stage firms playing
games like this and wanted to be able to support our companies in
their later stages.

## Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet

T.
here is another type of term sheet that is important in an entre-
preneur's life-the letter of intent (LOI). Hopefully, one day you'll
receive one from a potential acquirer that will lead to fame, riches,
and happiness. Or at least you'll get a new business card on heavier
card stock.

Typically, the first formal step by a company that wants to acquire
yours is for it to issue a letter of intent. This sometimes delightful
and usually nonbinding document (except for things like a no-
shop agreement) is also known as an indication of interest (IOI),
memorandum of understanding (MOU), and even occasionally a
term sheet.

As with our friend the term sheet, there are some terms that
matter a lot and others that don't. Once again there are plenty of
mysterious words that experienced deal makers always know how
and where to sprinkle so that they can later say, "But X implies Y,"
often resulting in much arguing between lawyers. We've had LOIs
get done in a couple of hours and had others take several months
to get signed. As with any negotiation, experience, knowledge, and
understanding matter. The LOI negotiation is usually a first taste of
the actual negotiating style you will experience from the other party.

This negotiation will be the beginning of the end of your inde-
pendence as a company. Unlike a venture financing where everyone
can win by expanding the pie over time, you are now negotiating for
a fixed pie. Subsequently, the tone and stress around these negotia-
tions are much tougher than a regular venture financing.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageNumber="176" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

To keep things straightforward, we are going to focus on explain-
ing the typical case of a two-party transaction between a buyer and
a seller, which we'll refer to as an acquisition. As with many things in
life, there are often more complex transactions, including three or
more parties, but we'll save that for a different book.

By the time the buyer presents the seller with an LOI, there have
been meetings, discussions, dinners, expensive bottles of wine, lots
of conference calls, and an occasional argument. However, the buyer
and the seller are still courting so they tend to be on their best behav-
ior. The LOI is typically the first real negotiation and the true ice-
breaker for the relationship.

In ancient times, when the first LOI was presented, someone
crafted an introductory paragraph that started with something like
the following:

Dear CEO of Seller:

We have greatly enjoyed our conversations to date and are hon-
ored to present you with this letter of intent to acquire [Seller's
Company]. We look forward to entering into serious discussions
over the next several months and reaching an agreement to
acquire your company. We'd like to thank you for entertaining
our proposal, which follows:

While every company has its own style, most LOIs begin with
some variation of this boilerplate paragraph. Of course, you'll find-
later in the LOI-a qualifier that states that almost everything in the
LOI is nonbinding, including the appearance of civility as part of the
negotiation.


### Structure of a Deal

As with financings, there are only a couple of things that really
matter-in this case price and structure. Since the first question
anyone involved in a deal typically asks is "What is the price?," we'll
start there.

Unlike a venture financing in which price is usually pretty
straightforward to understand, figuring out the price in an acquisi-
tion can be more difficult. There is usually some number floated in
early discussions, but this isn't really the actual price since there are a
lot of factors that can (and generally will) impact the final price of a

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="177" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

deal by the time the negotiations are finished and the deal is closed.
It's usually a safe bet to assume that the easy-to-read number on the
first page of the LOI is the best-case scenario purchase price. Follow-
ing is an example of what you might see in a typical LOI:

Purchase Price/Consideration: $100 million of cash will be paid
at closing, $15 million of which will be subject to the terms of
the escrow provisions described in paragraph 3 of this Letter
of Intent. Working capital of at least $1 million shall be deliv-
ered at closing. Forty million dollars of cash will be subject to
an earn-out and $10 million of cash will be part of a manage-
ment retention pool. Buyer will not assume outstanding options
to purchase Company Common Stock, and any options to pur-
chase shares of Company Common Stock not exercised prior
to the Closing will be terminated as of the Closing. Warrants to
purchase shares of Company capital stock not exercised prior to
the Closing will be terminated as of the Closing.

Before this paragraph was drafted, it's likely that a number
around $150 million was discussed as the purchase price. The first
thing that jumps out is the reference to a $15 million escrow. The
escrow (also known as a holdback) is money that the buyer is going
to hang on to for some period of time to satisfy any issues that come
up post financing that are not disclosed in the purchase agreement.
In some LOIs we've seen extensive details, wherein each provision
of the escrow is spelled out, including the percentage of the hold-
back, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity agreement.
In other cases, there is mention that "standard escrow and indem-
nity terms shall apply." We'll discuss specific escrow language later
(i.e., you'll have to wait until "paragraph 3"), but it's safe to say two
things: first, there is no such thing as standard language; and sec-
ond, whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual
purchase price should any claim be brought under it. So, clearly,
the amount and terms of the escrow and indemnity provisions are
very important.

Next is the reference to $1 million of working capital. While
this might not seem like a big number, it's still $1 million. Many
young companies end up with negative working capital at closing
(working capital is current assets minus current liabilities) due to
debt, deferred revenue, warranty reserves, inventory carry costs,

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="178" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

and expenses and fees associated with the deal. As a result, these
working capital adjustments directly decrease the purchase price if
upon closing (or other predetermined date after the closing) the
seller's working capital is less than an agreed-upon amount. Assume
that unless the working capital threshold is a slam-dunk situation
where the company has clearly complied with this requirement, the
determination will be a battle that can have a real impact on the
purchase price. In some cases, this can act in the seller's favor to
increase the value of the deal if the seller has more working capital
on the balance sheet than the buyer requires, but only if the clause
around working capital is bidirectional (it's not in this example).
Finally, it feels silly and gratuitous to us when a multibillion-dollar
company asks for any working capital number above zero from
a startup.

While earn-outs sound like a mechanism to increase price, in
our experience, they usually are a tool that allows the acquirer to
underpay at time of closing and pay full value only if certain hur-
dles are met in the future. In our example, the acquirer suggested
that it was willing to pay $150 million, but is really paying only
$100 million with $40 million of the deal subject to an earn-out.
We'll cover earn-outs separately since there are a lot of permuta-
tions, especially if the seller is receiving stock instead of cash as its
consideration.

In our example, the buyer has explicitly carved out $10 million
for a management retention pool. This has become common since
buyers want to make sure that management has a clear and direct
future financial incentive. In this case, it's built into the purchase
price (e.g., $150 million). We've found that buyers tend to be split
between building it into the purchase price and putting it on top
of the purchase price. In either case, it is effectively part of the
deal consideration but is at risk since it'll typically be paid out over
several years to the members of management who continue their
roles at the acquirer. If someone leaves, that portion of the man-
agement retention pool tends to vanish into the same place socks
lost in the dryer go. In addition, it's a move on the part of the buyer
to allocate some percentage of the purchase price away from the
formal ownership (or capitalization table) of the company as a way
of driving an early negotiating wedge between management and
the investors.

## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

By the time someone is offering you a lot of money to buy your company, you
should have good counsel or advisers or independent board members to help
you navigate the terms. The structure of the deal is very important. You should
be willing to stand behind your representations and warrantees with a reason-
able 12- to 18-month escrow at a minimum. If you can't, you look like you're
hiding something. Management retention pool, working capital, and earn-outs
are just negotiation points around the certainty and price of a deal.

Finally, there are a bunch of words in our example about the buyer
not assuming stock options and warrants. We'll explain this in more
detail later, but, like the working capital clause, it can impact the over-
all value of the deal based on what people are expecting to receive.


### Asset Deal versus Stock Deal

While price is usually the first issue on every seller's mind, structure
should be second. Lawyers talk about two types of deals, asset deals
and stock deals, but there are numerous structural issues surround-
ing each type of deal. Let's begin by discussing the basics of an asset
deal and a stock deal.

In general, all sellers want to do stock deals and all buyers want
to do asset deals. Just to increase the confusion level, a stock deal
can be done for cash and an asset deal can be done for stock. Don't
confuse the type of deal with the actual consideration received.

Sarcastic VCs on the seller side will refer to an asset deal as a
situation "when buying a company is not really buying a company."
Buyers will request this structure, with the idea that they will buy only
the particular assets that they want out of a company, leave certain
liabilities (read: "warts") behind, and live happily ever after. If you
engage lawyers and accountants in this discussion, they'll ramble on
about something regarding taxes, accounting, and liabilities, but our
experience is that most of the time the acquirer is just looking to
buy the crown jewels, explicitly limit its liabilities, and craft a simpler
deal for itself at the expense of the seller. We notice that asset deals
are more popular in shaky economic times since acquirers are try-
ing to avoid creditor issues and successor liability. One saw relatively
few asset deals in the late 1990s, but in early 2000 asset deals became

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="180" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

much more popular; yet by 2016 asset deals are once again rarely
seen and only in distressed situations.

While asset deals can work for a seller, the fundamental problem
for the seller is that the company hasn't actually been sold! The assets
have left the company (and are now owned by the buyer), but there
is still a shell corporation with contracts, liabilities, potential employ-
ees, and tax forms to file. Even if the company is relatively clean from
a corporate hygiene perspective, it may take several years (depend-
ing on tax, capital structure, and jurisdictional concerns) to wind
down the company. During this time, the officers and directors of
the company are still on the hook, and the company presumably has
few assets to operate the business (since they were sold to the buyer).

In the case of a stock deal, the acquirer is buying the entire com-
pany. Once the acquisition is closed, the seller's company disappears
into the corporate structure of the buyer and there is nothing left,
except possibly some T-shirts that found their way into the hands
of spouses and the company sign that used to be on the door just
before the deal closed. There is nothing to wind down, and the com-
pany is history.

So is an asset deal bad or is it just a hassle? It depends. It can be
really bad if the seller has multiple subsidiaries, numerous contracts,
employees with severance commitments, or disgruntled shareholders,
or it is close to insolvency. In this case, the officers and directors may
be taking on fraudulent conveyance liability by consummating an asset
deal. It's merely a hassle if the company is in relatively good shape, is
very small, or has few shareholders to consider. Of course, if any of
these things are true, then the obvious rhetorical question is, "Why
doesn't the acquirer just buy the whole company via a stock deal?"

In our experience, we see stock deals the vast majority of the
time. Often, the first draft of the LOI is an asset deal, but it's often
the first point raised by sophisticated sellers and they are often suc-
cessful in ending up with a stock deal except in extreme circum-
stances when the company is in dire straits. Many buyers go down a
path to discuss all the protection they get from an asset deal. This is
generally nonsense since a stock deal can be configured to provide
functionally equivalent protection for the buyer with a lot less hassle
for the seller. In addition, asset deals are no longer the protection
they used to be with regard to successor liability in a transaction,
since courts are much more eager to find a company that purchases
substantial assets of another company to be a so-called successor in
interest with respect to liabilities of the seller.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="181" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

The structure of the deal is also tied closely to the tax issues
surrounding a deal. Once you start trying to optimize for structure
and taxes, you end up defining the type of consideration (stock or
cash) the seller can receive. It can get complicated very quickly,
and pretty soon you can feel like you are climbing up a staircase
in an Escher drawing. We'll dig into tax and consideration in a bit;
just realize that they are all linked together and usually ultimately
impact price, which is-after all-what the seller usually cares most
about.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

If your company is in bad shape, you will probably have no choice but to do an
asset sale and deal with the liabilities and associated winding down of the entity
yourself. You should be prepared for this situation and constantly be calculating
the expense and hassle of an asset deal to understand what kind of alternatives
you're willing to consider.


## Form of Consideration

Imagine the following conversation between an entrepreneur and
a VC:

Entrepreneur: "I just received an offer for the company for $15 mil-
lion from Company X."

VC: "Awesome. Who's Company X? I've never heard of them."

Entrepreneur: "It's a private company funded by Venture Firm Y."
VC: "Cool-$15 million. Is it a cash deal?"

Entrepreneur: "No, it's all stock."

VC: "Hmmm-are you getting preferred or common stock?"

Entrepreneur: "Common stock. Why?"

VC: "How much money has the company raised?"

Entrepreneur: "$110 million."

VC: "What's the liquidation preference? Is it a participating pre-
ferred? What's the valuation of the company?"

Entrepreneur: "Oh, I'm not worried about that stuff. The valuation
is $300 million and they say they are going public soon."

If you paid attention to the first part of this book, you know where
this is going. The entrepreneur just received an offer for his company

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="182" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

for 5% of the acquirer (actually 4.76% on a post-transaction basis) in
an illiquid stock in a private company that is sitting under $110 million
of liquidation preferences (and more than that if the preference is
participating). If our friend calls his friendly neighborhood financial
appraiser to do a valuation analysis, he'll find out the $15 million he
thinks he is getting is actually valued at a lot less (probably good for
tax purposes, not so good for buying beer, sports cars, and second
houses).

The form of consideration matters a lot. Cash is-well-king.
Everything else is something less. And it can be a lot less. Did you hear
the one where the acquirer offered "free software products" up to a
certain amount in exchange for the company's assets? Gee, er, thanks.

Obviously, cash is easy to understand and to value. Stock can be
more complicated. If it's stock in a private company, understanding
the existing capital structure is a critical first step to understanding
what you are getting. If it's stock in a public company, you'll want
to ask a variety of questions, including whether the stock is freely
tradable, registered, or subject to a lockup agreement. If it's freely
tradable, will you be considered an insider after the transaction and
have any selling restrictions? If it's not freely tradable, what kind of
registration rights will you have? It can get messy quickly, especially if
you try to optimize for tax (there's that tax thing again).

It's important to realize that the value of your company and the
price you are getting paid may not be the same. Don't let yourself get
locked into a price early in the negotiation until you understand the
form of consideration you are receiving.


## Assumption of Stock Options

After considering price and structure, it is time to discuss other
major deal points generally found in an LOI. One item to note here:
absence of these terms in your particular LOI may not be a good
thing, as in our experience detailed LOIs are better than vague ones
(but be careful not to overlawyer the LOI). Specifically, this is the
case because during the LOI discussions most of the negotiating is
between the business principals of the deal, not their lawyers, who
will become the main deal drivers after the signing of the term sheet.
Our experience is that leaving material business points to the law-
yers will slow down the process, increase deal costs, and cause much
unneeded pain and angst. Our suggestion would be to always have

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="183" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

most of the key terms clearly spelled out in the LOI and agreed to
by the business principals before the lawyers bring out their clubs,
quivers, and broadswords.

The way stock options are handled (regardless of how you
address the 409A issues, which we'll discuss later) can vary greatly
in the LOI. Over the past five years, the practice of what happens to
stock options in a merger has changed greatly. Let's start by discuss-
ing some history.

Prior to 2010 nearly all well-drafted option plans provided for
automatic assumption of the plan. If a company was acquired, the
plan would automatically be assigned to and assumed by the acquirer;
otherwise, all the unvested options would immediately vest and the
employees would cash out immediately. This approach provided an
incentive to all parties to have the options assumed. Since nothing is
free in this world, the costs to assume the plan (not the legal costs,
but the total consideration owed to employees under the plan) was
netted against the purchase price. Simply stated, if the assumed plan
converted to options of the acquirer worth $10 million, then $10 mil-
lion would come off the purchase price.

The theory behind this approach was to protect the employees
of the company who are not at the bargaining table during an acqui-
sition. In the last decade, acquirers began to substitute forms of con-
sideration they viewed as comparable rather than simply assuming
the option plan. Instead of options, they might create a cash-backed
incentive plan for employees. Or, they'd choose restricted stock
units (RSUs) instead of options because of arcane tax laws that force
companies to expense options. Regardless, acquirers wanted flex-
ibility to incentivize their new employees rather than being forced
into a specific approach.

In some cases, acquirers did not assume the plan, sometimes
due to tax laws, and all of the employee's options vested. While
that sounds employee friendly (it is), it can cause significant fric-
tion among employees. For instance, consider an employee who had
been at the company for three years and was mostly vested. This
employee saw relatively little vesting (one year) in contrast to the
employee who joined the company a month earlier and now got
three years and 11 months of vesting.

As time passed, the option plans evolved. Today, the general
approach is that options plans allow for the assumption or substi-
tution of similar plans, but explicitly state that the acquirer has no

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="184" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

obligation to do much at all. The board of the acquired company
can vote to accelerate the options if it chooses, but are no longer
guaranteed protections for employees with stock options. Usually,
this doesn't matter, as the parties (both the target and the buyer,
along with their respective boards of directors) do the right thing by
employees. But this is not always the case.

We've seen situations where the buyer refused to assume the option
plan or provide any meaningful substitute consideration. In this case,
the employees with options get hosed and those who are vested get all
the consideration. In these cases, the acquirer only cares about tech-
nology, the management team, and long-serving employees.

We've seen other cases where the acquirer offered to either
assume or substitute (again with RSUs) the option plan, but then
asked key members of the team to "revest" their options. Revesting
means that even if an employee has vested a certain amount of their
options, they have to stick around for a predetermined period of
time to vest them again. For example, presume that the acquirer
wants everyone to revest all of their options over two years. It doesn't
matter how many options you've already vested-you now start the
vesting clock over. Typically, the acquirer will do something more
complicated, like give everyone vesting credit for up to two years
but then revest any remaining options over four years. This costs the
acquirer nothing but has a meaningful impact on potential consider-
ation for employees that is dependent on how long they stay.

Another issue impacting stock options is whether the acquisition is
in cash, public company stock, or private company stock. We're going
to ignore tax considerations for the moment (although you shouldn't
ignore them in a real-world acquisition). If I'm an employee of a seller,
I'm going to value cash differently from public stock (restricted or
unrestricted) and public stock options differently from private stock
(or options). If the buyer is public or is paying cash, the calculation
is straightforward and can be easily explained to the employee. If the
buyer is private, this becomes much more challenging and is some-
thing that management and the representatives of the seller who are
structuring the transaction should think through carefully.

The basis of stock options (also known as the strike price or barter
element)-and who pays for it-should also be considered as it
reduces the value of the stock options. Specifically, if the value of
a share of stock in a transaction is $1 and the basis of the stock
option is $0.40, the actual value of the stock option at the time of

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="185" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

the transaction is $0.60. Many sellers forget to try to recapture the
value of the barter element in the purchase price and allow the total
purchase price to be the gross value of the stock options (vested and
unvested) rather than getting incremental credit on the purchase
price for the barter element.

Let's assume you have a $100 million cash transaction with $10
million going to option holders, 50% of which are vested and 50% are
unvested. Assume for simplicity that the buyer is assuming unvested
options but including them in the total purchase price (the $100 mil-
lion) and that the total barter element of the vested stock is $1 million
and the barter element of the unvested stock is $3 million. The vested
stock has a value of $4 million ($5 million value minus $1 million
barter element) and the unvested stock has a value of $2 million ($5
million value minus $3 million barter element). So the option holders
are going to net only $6 million total. Often, the seller will catch the
vested stock amount (e.g., vested options will account for $4 million
of the $100 million), but the full $5 million will be allocated to the
unvested options (instead of the actual value/cost to the buyer of $2
million). This is a material difference (e.g., the difference between
$91 million going to the non-option holders versus $94 million).

Of course, all of this assumes that the stock options are in the
money. If the purchase price of the transaction puts the options out
of the money (e.g., the purchase price is below the liquidation pref-
erence), all of this is irrelevant since the options are worthless.

While this is dense stuff, it's important to address it during the
LOI phase to make sure you are doing the right thing in the context
of the deal for both your employees and your investors. It's easy to
punt this until later in the process, only to find that you are now
stuck in the middle of a multiparty negotiation between the buyer,
your investors, and your employees with no obvious way to satisfy
everyone. Also, by this time you've stopped negotiations with other
suitors and have no real negotiation leverage.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

In most cases, your employees got your company to where it is. Do not sell them
short in an exit, whether or not there is an earn-out that compels you to keep
them happy. Your reputation as an entrepreneur is at stake here, plus you want
to do the right thing.

### Representations, Warranties, and Indemnification

Every LOI will have some mention of representations and warranties,
also called "reps and warranties" or just "reps" by those in the know.
The reps and warranties are the facts and assurances about the busi-
ness that one party gives the other. In most LOIs, the language in
this paragraph is light in substance, but this section can have a pro-
found effect on the deal and consume a ridiculous amount of legal
time during the negotiation of the definitive agreement.

The first thing to note is who is making the representations.
Does it say the selling company will be making the reps, or does it
say the selling company and its shareholders are on the hook? Or,
more typically, is it silent as to who exactly is stepping up to the plate?
Given that many shareholders (including VCs and individuals who
hold stock in the selling company) are unwilling or unable to repre-
sent and warrant to the seller's situation, it's important to resolve in
the LOI who is actually making the reps. Optimally you can get this
solved before the lawyers start fighting over this, since most buyers
will eventually accept that the company, instead of the underlying
shareholders in the company, is making the reps.

All LOIs will have something regarding indemnification in the
event that one of the reps or warranties is breached. Considering
how important this provision is to the seller in an acquisition, it's
often the case that the buyer will try to sneak past the following lan-
guage in the LOI.

The Company shall make standard representations and warran-
ties and provide standard indemnification to Acquirer.

This is code for:

We are really going to negotiate hard on the indemnification
terms, but don't want to tell you at this stage so that you'll sign
the LOI and become committed to doing the deal. Really-trust
us-our deal guys and lawyers are nice and cuddly.

Depending on the situation of the seller (perhaps the seller is in
a position whereby it wants to get the buyer committed more than
vice versa and is willing to take its chances with the lawyers arguing),
we'd suggest that you at least sketch out what the indemnification

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="187" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

will look like. Again, once the lawyers get involved, arguments like
"It's market and it's nonnegotiable" or "I get this on all of my deals"
get bantered about endlessly.

The buyer usually makes some reps as well, but since it is paying
for the seller, these are typically pretty lightweight unless the buyer is
paying in private company stock. If you are a seller and you are get-
ting private stock from the buyer, a completely logical starting point
is to make all the reps and warranties reciprocal.

While many of these reps and warranties may look similar to the
ones in your venture financing documents, VCs almost never sue
companies they invest in. However, in acquisitions the reps and war-
ranties often come into play after the merger is completed, so you
should understand them and take them seriously.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As long as most of your reps and warranties are qualified by a phrase like "to
the extent currently known ... ," you should have no problem signing them.
Arguing against them is a big red flag to investors or buyers.


### Escrow

The escrow is another hotly negotiated term that often is left ambig-
uous in the LOI. The escrow (also known as a holdback) is money
that the buyer is going to hang on to for some period of time to sat-
isfy any issue that comes up post acquisition that is not disclosed in
the purchase agreement.

In some LOIs we've seen extensive details-with each provision
of the escrow agreement spelled out-including the percentage
of the holdbacks, length of time, and carve-outs to the indemnity
agreement. In other cases, there is simply a declaration that "stan-
dard escrow and indemnity terms shall apply." Since there really isn't
any such thing as a standard term, this is another buyer-centric trap
for deferring what can become a brutal negotiation in the post-LOI
stage. Whatever the escrow arrangement is, it will decrease the actual
purchase price should any claim be brought under it, so the terms of
the agreement can be very important since they directly impact the
value that the seller receives.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="188" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

In our experience over hundreds of acquisitions, an escrow is
typically set up as the sole remedy for breaches of the reps and
warranties, with a few exceptions, known as carve-outs. Normally
between 10% and 20% of the aggregate purchase price is set aside
for between 12 and 24 months to cure any breaches of the reps.
While this is usually where the escrow terms end up (and are usu-
ally described as the escrow caps), it can take a herculean effort to
get there. Buyers often try to overreach, especially if the parameters
are not defined in the LOI, by asking for things such as uncapped
indemnity if anything goes wrong, personal liability of company
executives and major shareholders, and even the ability to capture
more value than the deal is worth.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Buyers overreaching on the escrow terms are silly, especially if you have a
well-run business with audited financials and outside directors. Remember,
when a public company gets acquired, its reps and warranties usually expire
at the closing!

The carve-outs to the escrow caps typically include fraud, capi-
talization, and taxes. Often, especially due to the risk of attack by
patent trolls, a buyer will press for intellectual property ownership to
be carved out. We've also started to see liabilities resulting from lack
of 409A compliance be carved out in escrow agreements under the
argument that 409A is equivalent to taxes. In all cases, the maximum
of the carve-out should be the aggregate deal value, as the seller
shouldn't have to come up with more than it was paid in the deal to
satisfy an escrow claim.

A lot of buyers will say something like "Well, I can't figure the
specifics out until I do more due diligence." We say baloney to that
as we've yet to meet a buyer that was unable to put an initial escrow
proposal, with some detail and caps defined, in the LOI. This lan-
guage is still subject to due diligence but is harder to retrade after it
has been agreed to since something of substance has to emerge for
there to be a legitimate discussion about it.

Finally, the form of consideration of the escrow is important. In
a cash deal, it's easy-it's cash. However, in a stock deal or a deal that
has a combination of cash and stock, the value of the escrow will

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="189" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

float with the stock price, and the value can vary even more dramati-
cally over time if it's private company stock. There are lots of permu-
tations on how to best manage this on the seller side; you should be
especially thoughtful about this if you have concerns that the buyer's
stock is particularly volatile. Imagine the situation where the stock
price declines but the buyer's escrow claims are of greater value than
the stock in escrow represents. Reasonable people should be able to
agree that the seller doesn't have to come up with extra money to
satisfy the claims.


### Confidentiality/Nondisclosure Agreement

While VCs will almost never sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs)
in the context of an investment, NDAs are almost always mandatory
in an acquisition. If the deal falls apart and ultimately doesn't hap-
pen, both parties (the seller and the buyer) are left in a position
where they have sensitive information regarding the other. Further-
more, it's typically one of the few legally binding provisions in an
LOI other than the location of jurisdiction for any legal issues and
breakup fees. If the deal closes, this provision largely becomes irrel-
evant since the buyer now owns the seller.

Both the buyer and the seller should be aligned in their desire
to have a comprehensive and strong confidentiality agreement
since both parties benefit. If you are presented with a weak (or one-
sided) confidentiality agreement, it could mean that the acquirer is
attempting to learn about your company through the due diligence
process and may or may not be intent on closing the deal.

Generally, a one-sided confidentiality agreement makes no
sense-this should be a term that both sides are willing to sign up to
with the same standard. Public companies are often very particular
about the form of the confidentiality agreement. While we don't rec-
ommend sellers sign just anything, if it's bidirectional you are prob-
ably in a pretty safe position.


### Employee Matters

Although the board of a company has a fiduciary responsibility to
all employees and shareholders of a company, it's unfortunately not
always the case that management and the board are looking out
for all employees and all shareholders in an acquisition. In public
company acquisitions you often hear about egregious cases of senior

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="190" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

management looking out for themselves (and their board members
helping them line their pockets) at the expense of shareholders.
This can also happen in acquisitions of private companies, where
the buyer knows it needs the senior executives to stick around and
is willing to pay something extra for it. Of course, the opposite can
happen as well, where the consideration in an acquisition is slim and
the investors try to grab all the nickels for themselves, leaving man-
agement with little or nothing.

It's important for management and the board to have the proper
perspective on their individual circumstances in the context of the
specific deal that is occurring. Whenever we are on the board of
a company that is a seller, we prefer to defer the detailed discus-
sion about individual compensation until after the LOI is signed
and the managements of the buyer and the seller have time to do
due diligence on each other, build a working relationship, and
understand the logical roles of everyone going forward. Spending
too much time up front negotiating management packages often
results in a lot of very early deal fatigue, typically makes buyers
uncomfortable with the motivation of the management team for
the sale, and can often create a huge wedge between management
and the other shareholders on the seller's side. We aren't suggest-
ing that management and employees shouldn't be taken care of
appropriately in a transaction; rather, we believe there won't be
an opportunity to take care of everyone appropriately if you don't
actually get to the transaction. Overnegotiating this too early often
causes a lot of unnecessary stress, especially between management
and their investors.

While we don't recommend negotiating the employment agree-
ments too early in the process, we also don't recommend leaving
them to the very end of the process. Many buyers do this so they can
exert as much pressure as possible on the key employees of the seller
as everyone is ready to get the deal done, and the only thing hanging
it up is the employment agreements. Ironically, many sellers view the
situation exactly the opposite way (i.e., now that the deal is basically
done, we can ask for a bunch of extra stuff from the buyer). Neither
of these positions is very effective, and both usually result in unnec-
essary tension at the end of the deal process and occasionally create
a real rift between buyer and seller post transaction.

This is a particular situation where balance is important. When
it comes to employee matters, there's nothing wrong with a solid

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="191" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

negotiation. Just make sure that it happens in the context of a deal
or you may never actually get the deal done.


### Conditions to Close

Buyers normally include certain conditions to closing in the LOI.
These can be generic phrases such as "Subject to Board approval by
Acquirer," "Subject to the Company not having a material adverse
change," or "Subject to due diligence and agreement on definitive
documents." There can also be phrases that are specific to the sit-
uation of the seller such as "Subject to the Company settling out-
standing copyright litigation," or "Subject to Company liquidating
its foreign subsidiaries." We generally don't get too concerned about
this provision, because any of these deal outs are very easy to trigger
should the buyer decide that it doesn't want to do the deal.

Instead of worrying about whether the provision is part of the
LOI, we tend to focus on the details of the conditions to close since
this is another data point about the attitude of the buyer. If the list
of conditions is long and complex, you likely have a suitor with very
particular tastes. In this case it's worth pushing back early on a few of
these conditions to close, especially the more constraining ones, to
learn about what your negotiation process is going to be like.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

Remember, once buyers are in a significant legal and due diligence process
with you, they are as emotionally and financially committed to a deal as you are
(and in many cases, their reputation is on the line, too).

As the seller, you should expect that once you've agreed to spe-
cific conditions to close, you will be held to them. It's worth address-
ing these early in the due diligence process so you don't get hung up
by something unexpected when you have to liquidate a foreign sub-
sidiary or some other bizarre condition to close, especially if you've
never done this before.


### The No-Shop Clause

Signing a letter of intent starts a serious and expensive process for
both the buyer and the seller. As a result, you should expect that a
buyer will insist on a no-shop provision similar to the one that we

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="192" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

discussed around term sheets. In the case of an acquisition, no-shop
provisions are almost always unilateral, especially if you are dealing
with an acquisitive buyer.

As the seller you should be able to negotiate the length of time
into a reasonable zone such as 45 to 60 days. If the buyer is asking
for more than 60 days, you should push back hard since it's never in
a seller's interest to be locked up for an extended period of time. In
addition, most deals should be able to be closed within 60 days from
signing of the LOI, so having a reasonable deadline forces everyone
to be focused on the actual goal of closing the deal.

Since most no-shop agreements will be unilateral, the buyer will
typically have the right but not the obligation to cancel the no-shop
if it decides not to go forward with the deal. As a result, the time win-
dow is particularly important since the seller is likely to be tied up for
the length of the no-shop even if the deal doesn't proceed. In some
cases an honorable buyer who has decided not to move forward with
a deal will quickly agree to terminate the no-shop; however, it's more
likely that the buyer will simply drag its feet until the no-shop expires.

In cases in which the deal is actively in process and the no-shop
period ends, the seller should expect a call from the buyer a few
days before the expiration of the no-shop with a request to extend
it. There is often some additional leverage that accrues to the seller
at this moment in time, including relief from a net worth threshold,
potential short-term financing from the buyer, or even very specific
concessions around reps and warranties that have been held up in
the negotiation. The seller should be careful not to overreach at this
moment since the tone for the final phase of the negotiation can be
set by the behavior around the extension of the no-shop. If the seller
asks for too much at this point in time, it can expect the buyer to
tighten down on everything else through the close of the deal.

Rather than fight the no-shop, we've found it more effective
to limit the duration of the no-shop period and carve out specific
events, most notably financings (at the minimum financings done by
the existing syndicate), to keep some pressure on the buyer.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

As with no-shops with VCs, no-shops with potential buyers should also have an
automatic out if the buyer terminates the process.

<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->


### Fees, Fees, and More Fees

The LOI will usually be explicit about who pays for which costs and
what limits exist for the seller to run up transaction costs in the
acquisition. Transaction costs associated with an agent or a banker,
the legal bill, and any other seller-side costs are typically included in
the transaction fee section. Though it's conceivable that the buyer
will punt on worrying about who covers transaction fees, most savvy
buyers are very focused on making sure the seller ends up eating
these, especially if they are meaningful amounts.

Occasionally, the concept of a breakup fee comes up for situ-
ations where the deal doesn't close or the seller ends up doing a
deal with another buyer. Breakup fees are rare in private company
VC-backed deals but prevalent in deals where one public company
acquires another public company. We generally resist any request of
a buyer to institute a breakup fee and tell the potential buyer to rely
on the no-shop clause instead. Most buyers of VC-backed companies
are much larger and more resource rich than the seller it seeks to
acquire, so it strikes us as odd that the buyer would receive a cash
windfall if the deal does not close, especially since both parties will
have costs incurred in the process. When we are the seller, we rarely
ask for a breakup fee.


## The Entrepreneur's Perspective

There are some rare circumstances in which a seller can reasonably ask for
a breakup fee. If the buyer is competitive and the seller is concerned that the
buyer may be entering the process as a fishing expedition as opposed to a
good-faith effort to buy the company, or if the seller incurs a massive amount
of customer or employee risk by entering into the deal, a breakup fee may
be appropriate.


## Registration Rights

When a public company is buying a private company for stock, it's
important for the seller to understand the registration characteris-
tics and rights associated with the stock it will be receiving. Some
buyers will try to ignore this; a good seller should work hard up front
to get agreement on what it will be receiving. Just because a company
is public doesn't mean all of their stock is tradable on a stock market.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="194" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

If you are receiving stock in an acquisition, you'll often receive unreg-
istered stock that will need to be registered before you can sell it.

If the buyer offers unregistered stock, it should come with a
promise to register the shares. It's important that the seller recog-
nize that this is almost always a nonbinding promise since the buyer
can't guarantee when it can register the shares because it is depen-
dent on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for this and
it doesn't control the SEC. The past history of the buyer with the
SEC is crucial, including knowing the current status of SEC filings,
any outstanding registration statements, and any promises that the
buyer has made to shareholders of other companies it has acquired.

We've experienced several cases in which buyers promised a
quick registration only to drag their feet on the filing after the deal
or have the filing get hung up at the SEC. In today's regulatory envi-
ronment, we've been amazed by the poor behavior of several of the
large accounting firms when they state they don't have time to work
on acquisition accounting questioned by the SEC, especially in situ-
ations in which the accounting firm is not going to be working with
the acquirer after the acquisition.

Pursuant to securities laws, if you receive unregistered stock and
hold it for a year, then you can sell it on the stock market on which
the company is listed. A year, however, can be a long time and involve
a lot of volatility, especially in a thinly traded stock. Make sure you
are getting what you think you are getting.


## Shareholder Representatives

Acquisitions are not actually finished when the deal closes and the
money trades hands. There are terms such as managing the escrow,
dealing with earn-outs, working capital adjustments, and even litiga-
tion concerning reps and warranties that will last long into the future.
In every acquisition, there is someone-referred to as the shareholder
representative-who is appointed to be the representative of all the
former shareholders in the seller to deal with these issues.

This lucky person, who is generally not paid anything for his ser-
vices, gets to deal with all the issues that arise between the buyer and
the seller after the transaction. These issues can be based around
buyer's remorse or be legitimate issues, and are often time consum-
ing and expensive to deal with, and impact the ultimate financial
outcome of the deal.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageHeader="Letters of Intent-The Other Term Sheet" -->

Traditionally, either an executive from the seller or one of the
VC board members takes on this role. If nothing ever comes up, it's a
complete nonevent for this person. However, when something goes
awry where the buyer makes a claim on the escrow or threatens to
sue the former shareholders of the company, this job often becomes
a giant time-wasting nightmare. The shareholder rep, who typically
has a full-time job, limited money from the deal (often tied up in the
escrow) to hire professionals to help her, and usually isn't a subject
matter expert in anything that is at issue, ends up being responsible
for dealing with it. If it's an executive of the seller, she might still be
working for the buyer. In any case, this person is now making deci-
sions that impact all of the shareholders and subsequently ends up
spending time and energy communicating with them. Finally, some
buyers, in an effort to exert even more pressure on the system, sue
the shareholder reps directly.

We've each been shareholder reps many times. Several years ago,
we decided never to be shareholder reps again, as we see no upside
in taking on this responsibility.

If you somehow end up being the shareholder rep, make sure
you negotiate a pool of money into the merger agreement that you
can dip into to hire professionals to support you should something
arise that you have to deal with. We often see a separate escrow that is
used exclusively to pay for the expenses of the shareholder represen-
tative. If nothing else, this works to be a good shield to a bad-acting
buyer since it will see that you have money to hire lawyers to yell at
its lawyers.

Never ask someone who will be working for the buyer post
transaction to be the shareholder rep. If you do this, you are ask-
ing this person to get into a winner-takes-all fight against his current
employer, and that is not a happy position for anyone to be in. The
only time this ever works is if the shareholder rep has a role that is
critical to the buyer where the threat of the rep quitting will help
influence the outcome in a way positive to the seller. Regardless, this
is a stressful and uncomfortable position to be in.

You should also be wary of letting a VC take on this role. Escrow
and litigation dynamics are time sensitive, and we've had experi-
ences where other VCs involved as the shareholder rep paid little or
no attention to their responsibilities since they didn't fully under-
stand or appreciate the legal dynamics surrounding their role.
We've had some bizarre experiences, including a shareholder rep

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="196" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

who was a VC (a co-investor in a deal with us) who blew an escrow
situation by ignoring the notice he received from the buyer that
a claim had been breached. The notice period was 30 days, and
31 days after receiving the notice, the VC received another letter
saying the escrow had been deducted by the amount of the claim.
Fortunately, we had a good relationship with the lawyer on the side
of the buyer and were able to get an exception made, but the buyer
had no obligation to do this other than as a result of goodwill that
existed between the parties.

As a result of our experience with this over the years, Jason co-
founded a company called SRS Acquiom (www.srsacquiom.com),
which is an organization that acts as a shareholder rep. The cost, rel-
ative to the overall value of the deal, of using a firm like SRS is mod-
est and you get professionals who spend 100% of their time playing
the role of shareholder rep. When there is litigation, they get sued
and deal with all of the details. Given the wide range of deals they've
worked on as shareholder reps, they tend to have wide-ranging and
extensive experience with both buyers and their lawyers.

# Why Do Term Sheets Even Exist?

0
ne question that we often get is "why does the term sheet even
exist?" In fact, why do we need all of this legal paperwork in the
first place? Since a careful reader will point out that we have said
that it is rare a venture capitalist (VC) would sue one of its portfolio
companies on reps and warranties, why can't we do all of this with
a handshake or a simple document? Given that there are only a few
things that really matter, why have all of this ponderous structure
and legalese?

It turns out nothing requires that you use a term sheet. Our
favorite negotiations with entrepreneurs have been ones where
we've literally shaken hands and agreed on valuation, board struc-
ture, and option pool size verbally or over email. From there, we
just used our standard forms that we publish on the Foundry Group
website (http://foundrygroup.com/resources) and were done with
the deal in a few weeks. We find this spirit of collaboration and trust
attractive as it starts the working relationship off on the right foot.
The irony that we prefer doing deals without a term sheet is not lost
on us.

While this approach works if you are a sophisticated founder,
have worked with us before, or are working with attorneys who know
us well, this is the exception case. Usually, the term sheet will be the
first real negotiated document in a relationship.

Regardless of whether a term sheet is drafted or not, a plethora
of legal documents will need to be created. This is just a fact of life.
VCs need to answer to their investors who would not be comfortable

<!-- PageNumber="198" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

if we didn't have legal documents to protect their investment. Our
auditors would have nothing to look at to ensure we are getting what
we paid for and are valuing our portfolio correctly. Furthermore,
there are a few extreme cases out there where these documents were
important constraints to bad behavior. Typically, courts will not give
VCs any benefit of the doubt in contract negotiations so if we want a
provision, we have to get it clearly and explicitly in writing.

Along these lines, we thought it might be helpful to give you
the theories of why contracts like these exist. Properly drafted docu-
ments should help the parties align incentives so that each desires
to act in ways that are beneficial to one another. Following are some
general themes of what makes a contract truly useful in a relation-
ship and should serve as a framework when you consider particular
provisions in a contract. Once again, we thank our friend Brad
Bernthal (CU Law Professor) for his suggestions.


## Constraining Behavior and the Alignment of Incentives

Any good contractual relationship strives to be a win/win situation
for both parties, where each party is incentivized to act in each
other's best interests. Many things can drive this. It could be the
business relationship is so important to both parties that every-
one will be a good actor. There can be reputational constraints
involved. However, neither of these have any legal teeth to make
sure everyone behaves. So contracts were developed to make sure
that if something went awry, good behavior, to some extent, would
be enforceable.

While it's nice to think that people are generous of spirt, it's a fact
of life that most people, especially in a business context, are driven
by self-interest. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's helpful to
always keep this in mind. If you assume that your VC will do what is
best for both of you and it happens that these actions actually make
you both better off, then the relationship should be a smooth one. If
one day you awaken and realize that you are not on the same page,
then things can get interesting. For instance, remember the section
in the previous chapter around the treatment of stock options in an
acquisition. In this situation, there are numerous ways that you, your
VCs, and your employees will have radically different self-interests.
What benefits one group will directly adversely affect the others.
Or consider the situation of a capped liquidation preference with

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="199" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Why Do Term Sheets Even Exist?" -->

participation. Again, at the time of a sale of the business, the parties
may not be aligned.

We always suggest that you deal with things like this openly and
directly. Ultimately, if you can't reach an agreement on how to address
them, the situation will be bounded by the contractual terms that
you have agreed to beforehand. Because of this, it is critical to think
about how term sheets and contracts constrain bad behavior and align
incentives.

As we've discussed, the only two things that really matter in a
term sheet are economic and control provisions. We could have
said that the only two things that matter are making sure incentives
were aligned and that potential bad behavior is mitigated, but that
would be too academic for real life. However, keep in mind that the
constructs are analogous. Whenever you are trying to figure out if a
particular term is good or bad for you, consider how this will either
proactively or negatively (through veto powers) decrease the ability
for people to behave poorly, or whether or not they improve the
alignment of your incentives as well as your investors'. If something
feels out of whack and you think a particular provision divides you
and your investor's incentives, be very careful about accepting it. It's
in this vein that you have a very powerful negotiating tool. You don't
have to say "I don't want this term, it's not market." Instead, try the
approach of "Wait a minute, this term starts the relationship by divid-
ing us and resulting in our incentives being misaligned."

Outside of these two considerations, every good contract should
deal effectively with transactions costs, agency costs, and information
asymmetries, which we'll discuss below.


## Transaction Costs

There are different definitions of transaction costs, but for our pur-
poses they are the costs-in both time and money-associated with
creating a relationship between two parties. For instance, in closing
a venture deal between an entrepreneur and a VC, transaction costs
will include not only the costs of lawyers for both sides but also the
costs of meetings, the time involved to do due diligence upon one
another, and every step of the process from that first meeting to the
signed definitive documents.

If you go back 25 years, it was difficult to get your startup funded,
not just because there were fewer VCs, but because there were high

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="200" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

transaction costs to deal with. There were no standard forms of docu-
ments accepted by the industry, so lawyers spent a lot of time arguing
about things. There was no ubiquity of electronic communications.
This meant meetings were in-person meetings and hard to schedule.
There was no instant communication method. Furthermore, couri-
ers shuffled documents back and forth (Jason's old law firm had bike,
car, and plane couriers staffed full time at the office). Thankfully,
technology, transparency, and discussion online and in books like
this have dramatically lowered these costs. The dynamics of a financ-
ing is no longer a black box controlled by lawyers and a few knowl-
edgeable investors.

When entering a contractual relationship, consider that all good
contracts minimize current and future transaction costs. As we dis-
cussed earlier, convertible debt became increasing popular due
to the lower legal fees associated with it when compared to equity
rounds. Fifteen years ago an equity financing cost four times that of
a convertible debt financing. Today, there isn't much difference at
all. When determining what structure to use to raise money for your
company, consider what the transaction costs will be to get the deal
done.

We find future transaction costs to be even more important
to consider. For instance, we suggest that you negotiate a detailed
merger letter of intent (LOI) before signing it in order to avoid
too much negotiation ambiguity while drafting the definitive
documents. As you have more negotiating power during the LOI
stage, what would take two hours to negotiate now could save you
tens of hours later. In short, you are defining the relationship up
front so that you don't have to run up huge costs, both in time and
money, figuring out who has which rights and who receives what
consideration.


## Agency Costs and Information Asymmetry

Agency costs are costs associated with an agent acting on behalf of
a principal. Some of these costs are direct. If I hire a stockbroker to
buy stocks for me, I must also pay them a fee to complete the trade.
Some of these costs are indirect and hard to spot.

Let's use the example of a walking dead portfolio company. This is a
company that is still in business, but just limping along with no clear

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="201" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Why Do Term Sheets Even Exist?" -->

path to an outcome. It would probably be in the VC's best interest if
the company shut down so the VC could recoup whatever money is
left in the bank account and take the tax loss.

Let's consider the VC the principal in the scenario. The CEO,
however, has other incentives. He still has a decent salary and gets
to walk around town with his CEO business card. His incentive is to
keep the company alive as long as possible. The CEO in this case is
the agent.

Regardless of the amount of time the VC and the entrepreneur
spends together, there is no way either party will know as much about
the other's business-and motivation-as they know about their
own. This information asymmetry, like agency dynamics, results in a
misalignment of incentives.

Consider which contractual provisions could help alleviate
this conflict. A contractual right to a board seat for the VC would
be helpful. An odd number of board members, with at least one
independent board member, would be relevant. The VC having
redemption rights, while not necessarily palatable to the CEO, pro-
vides some additional pressure in the context of making a decision
about what to do. The idea of a liquidation preference, occasionally
referred to as schmuck insurance, is additional protection for the
investor.


## Reputation Constraints

If you are playing a long-term game, reputation constraints can be even
more important than a specific term in a contract. The venture indus-
try is small and reputation matters a lot. Bad behavior gets talked
about, even if it's done quietly and not out in the open. The smaller
the ecosystem, the more this phenomenon exists, so as you focus on
smaller geographies, the importance of reputation increases.

While there are some people who care less about their reputation
than others, your reputation will be established over a long period
of time. While no contract is airtight, how you deal with ambiguity
and conflict will help define your reputation. This impacts both
entrepreneurs and investors. Do your homework and find out the
real reputation of the other party that you are dealing with. In some
regards, this is the most important term of them all.

# Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know

T.
here are a few legal issues that we've seen consistently become
hurdles for entrepreneurs and their lawyers. While in some cases
they will simply be a hassle to clean up in a financing or an exit,
they often have meaningful financial implications for the company
and, in the worst case, can seriously damage the value of your busi-
ness. We aren't your lawyers or giving you legal advice here (our
lawyers made us write that), but we encourage you to understand
these issues rather than just assume that your lawyer got them right.

If you want to read the best book ever written on legal issues that
face entrepreneurs, get the book The Entrepreneur's Guide to Business
Law, Fourth Edition, by Constance Bagley and Craig Dauchy (South-
Western, 2012). It is written for entrepreneurs, not lawyers, so it's easily
digestible and is the best legal resource we know for entrepreneurs.


## Intellectual Property

Intellectual property (IP) issues can kill a startup before you even
really begin. Following is an example.

You and a friend go out and get some beers. You start telling him
about your new company that will revolutionize X and make you a
lot of money. You spend several hours talking about the business
model, what you need to build, and the product requirements. After
one beer too many, you both stumble home happy.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="203" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="204" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

Your friend goes back to work at his job at Company X-like. You
picked this particular friend to vet your idea because you know that
your company is similar to some cutting-edge work he does at X-like.
There is even a chance that you'd want to hire this friend one day.

You spend the next six months bootstrapping your company and
release a first version of your product. A popular tech blog writes
about it and you start getting inbound calls from venture capitalists
(VCs) wanting to fund you. You can't stop smiling and are excited
about how glorious life as an entrepreneur is.

The next day, your beer buddy calls and says that he's been laid
off from Company X-like and wants to join your company. You tell
him as soon as you get funding you'd love to hire him. Your friend
says, "That's okay-I can start today for no pay since I own 50% of
the company." You sit in stunned silence for a few seconds.

As you discuss the issue, your friend tells you that he owns 50%
of the IP of your company since you guys went out and basically
formed the company over beers. You tell him that you disagree
and he doesn't own any of the company. He tells you his uncle is
a lawyer.

As strange as this sounds, this is a real example. While we think
the claim by your so-called friend is ridiculous, if he takes action
(via his uncle, who is likely working for him for free), he can slow
down your VC financing. If he stays after you and you don't give him
something, it's possible that he'll end up completely stifling your
chance to raise money. If you happen to get lucky (for instance, if
your so-called friend accidentally gets hit by a bus), you still have the
outstanding issue that Company X-like may also have a claim on the
IP if there is an actual lawsuit filed and X-like happens to stumble
upon piecing the story together.

There are endless stories like this in startup land, including the
history of the founding of Facebook, popularized (and fictionalized)
by the movie The Social Network. Our example is one extreme, but
there are others, like students starting a company in an MBA class
where two go on to actually start the business while the other two
don't, but terrorize the company for ownership rights later due to
their claimed IP contributions. Or the entrepreneur who hired a
contractor to write code for him, paid the contractor, but still ended
up in litigation with the contractor, who claimed he owned IP above
and beyond what he was paid for. Realize that even if you pay for
code written by someone else, you don't own the code unless you get

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="205" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know" -->

whoever wrote the code to sign a document saying that the code was
"work for hire." Those exact words are critical.

When things like this come up, even the most battle-hardened
VC will pause and make sure that there are no real IP issues involved.
Responsible VCs who want to invest in your company will work with
you to solve this stuff, especially when absurd claims like the exam-
ples we just gave are being made. In our experience, there's often a
straightforward resolution except in extreme circumstances.

The key is being careful, diligent, and reasonably paranoid up
front. When friends are involved, you can usually work this stuff out
with a simple conversation. However, when talking to random peo-
ple, be careful of unscrupulous characters, especially those you know
nothing about.

Some entrepreneurs, and many lawyers, think the right solution
is to carefully guard your idea or have everyone you talk to sign a
nondisclosure agreement (NDA). We don't agree with this position.
Instead, we encourage entrepreneurs to be very open with their
ideas, and we generally believe NDAs aren't worth very much. How-
ever, be conscious of whom you are talking to. If there are few repu-
tational constraints to someone acting badly, then think hard before
disclosing your IP to them. If you do start heading down the path
of actually creating a business, make sure you have competent legal
counsel help you document it.


## Employment Issues

The most common lawsuits entrepreneurs face are ones around
employment issues. These are never pleasant, especially in the con-
text of an employee you've recently fired, but they are an unfortu-
nate result of today's work context.

There are a few things you can do to protect against this. First,
make sure that everyone you hire is an at-will employee. Without
these specific words in the offer letter, you can end up dealing with
state employment laws (which vary from state to state) that deter-
mine whether you can fire someone. We've encountered some chal-
lenging situations in certain states in the United States that made
firing almost as challenging as firing them in parts of Europe.

Next, consider whether you want to prebake severance terms
into an offer letter. For instance, you might decide that if you let
someone go, they will receive additional vesting or cash compensation.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="206" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

If you don't decide this at the outset, you may be left with a situation
where you are able to fire someone, but they claim that you owe
them something on the way out. However, determining up-front sev-
erance is about as much fun as negotiating a prenuptial agreement,
and the downside to it is that it limits your flexibility, especially if the
company is in a difficult financial situation and needs to fire people
to lower its burn rate in order to conserve cash to survive.

Every entrepreneur should know at least one good employment
lawyer. Dealing with these particular issues can be stressful and unpre-
dictable, especially given the extensive rules around discrimination
that again vary from state to state, and a knowledgeable employment
lawyer can quickly help you get to an appropriate resolution when
something comes up.


## State of Incorporation

While you can incorporate your business in 50 states, there are a
few preferred states to incorporate in, especially when you are plan-
ning to seek VC backing. Most VCs prefer one of three states: Dela-
ware, whichever state the company is in, or whichever state the VC
is located in.

Delaware is common because corporate law for Delaware is
well defined and generally business friendly, and most lawyers in
the United States are adept at dealing with Delaware law. If you are
planning on ultimately having an initial public offering (IPO), most
investment bankers will insist on your being incorporated in Dela-
ware before they will take you public. More importantly, lots of obvi-
ous things that are difficult or not permitted in some states, such as
faxed signature pages or rapid response to requests for changes in
corporate documents, are standard activities in Delaware.

The only two disadvantages of being incorporated in Delaware
are that you will have to pay some extra (but very modest) taxes and
potentially comply with two sets of corporate laws. For instance, if
you are located in California and are a Delaware corporation, you'll
have to comply with Delaware law and some of California law, too,
despite being a Delaware corporation.

Either of the other two common choices, the location of the
company or the location of the VC, is generally fine also. However, if
a VC has no experience with your state's corporate laws, you'll occa-
sionally find resistance for incorporating in your state. We view this

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="207" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know" -->

as rational behavior on the part of the VC, especially when the VC
joins the board because the VC then ends up being personally liable
as a director under the state's corporate laws. Since these laws can
vary widely, we always encourage Delaware as the default case.


## Type of Corporate Structure

There are three different corporate structures you can use for your
company: a C Corp, S Corp, or an LLC. If you are going to raise
venture capital, you will want to be a C Corp, but it's useful to under-
stand why and when you might benefit from the other corporation
structures.

If you are not going to raise any VC or angel money, an S Corp
is the best structure as it has all the tax benefits and flexibility of a
partnership-specifically a single tax structure versus the potential
for the double tax structure of a C Corp-while retaining the liability
protection of a C Corp.

Often, an LLC (limited liability company) will substitute for
an S Corp (it has similar dynamics), although it's much harder to
effectively grant equity to employees. Instead of stock options, LLCs
use membership units, which few employees have experience with.
In addition, stock options have better and more clearly defined tax
dynamics. LLCs work well for companies with a limited number of
owners. They don't work as well when the ownership starts to be
spread among multiple people.

If you are going to raise VC or angel money, a C Corp is the best
(and often required) structure. In a VC-/angel-backed company,
you'll almost always end up with multiple classes of stock, which are
not permitted in an S Corp. Since a VC-/angel-backed company is
expected to lose money for a while (in most cases that's the expecta-
tion for why you are raising money in the first place) the double taxa-
tion issues will be deferred. In addition, it's unlikely that you will be
distributing money out of a VC-/angel-backed company when you
become profitable.


## Accredited Investors

Though this isn't a book about securities laws (which, if it were,
would make it a dreadfully dull book), much of it is actually about
selling securities to investors. There are lots of laws that you need to

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="208" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

comply with in order to not get in trouble with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), and thus that is one of the major rea-
sons that you need to have a good lawyer.

When we wrote the prior editions of this book, it was illegal to
sell securities to anyone you wanted to. Now, in a crowdfunding/
post-JOBS Act world, you have many more options to whom you can
sell equities to. Nonetheless, the vast majority of entrepreneurs are
still sticking with the old regime of selling to accredited investors.
There are laws that effectively say that only rich and sophisticated
people are accredited investors allowed to buy stock in private compa-
nies. If you try to raise money from people who do not fit this defi-
nition, then you've probably committed a securities violation. This
means you should not ask your hairdresser, auto mechanic, and bag
boy at the grocery store to buy stock in your company unless they
are independently wealthy. Normally, the SEC doesn't catch most
people who do this, but it does happen sometimes.

If you ignore this advice and sell stock in your private company
to people who don't fit the SEC's definition of an accredited inves-
tor, then you have a lifelong problem on your hands. Specifically,
these nonaccredited investors can force you to buy back their shares
for at least their purchase price anytime they want, despite how your
company is doing. This right of rescission is a very real thing that we see
from time to time. It is particularly embarrassing when the person
forcing the buyback is a close family friend or relative who should
not have been offered the stock in the first place.


## Filing an 83(b) Election

This is another "if you don't do it right in the beginning you can't fix
it later" issue. If you don't file an 83(b) election within 30 days after
receiving your stock in a company, you will almost always lose capital
gains treatment of your stock when you sell it. We refer to this as the
mistake that will cause you to pay at least double the amount of taxes
that you should pay.

The 83 (b) election is a simple form that takes two minutes to exe-
cute. Most lawyers will provide the standard form as part of granting
your stock. Some will even provide a stamped and addressed enve-
lope, and the most client-friendly lawyers will even mail the form for
you. Or you can just Google "83 (b) election" and download the form
yourself. Note that you must send the form to the appropriate IRS
service center.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="209" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Legal Things Every Entrepreneur Should Know" -->

It's a bummer when you are in the middle of an acquisition and
you realize the 83(b) election is unsigned under a pile of papers on
your desk. For a firsthand account of this, take a look at the chapter
titled "To 83(b) or Not to 83(b)" in Brad's and David Cohen's book
Do More Faster (John Wiley & Sons, 2010).


## Section 409A Valuations

Our last random legal topic that often rears its ugly head around an
acquisition is Section 409A of the tax code, also known as the 409A
valuation. Section 409A says that all stock options given to employees
of a company need to be at fair market value.

In the old days before the turn of the millennium (pre-409A),
the board of a private company could determine what the fair mar-
ket value of a share of common stock was and this was acceptable
to the IRS. It became common practice that the share price for the
common stock, which is also the exercise price for the stock options
being granted, was typically valued at 10% of the price of the last
round of preferred stock. The exception was when a company was
within 18 months of an IPO, in which case the price of the common
stock converged with the price of the preferred stock as the IPO
drew nearer.

For some reason the IRS decided this wasn't the right way to
determine fair market value, came up with a new approach in Sec-
tion 409A of the tax code, and created dramatic penalties for the
incorrect valuation of stock options. The penalties included excise
taxes on the employee and potential company penalties. In addition,
some states, such as California, instituted their own penalties at the
state level. When Section 409A was first drafted, it sounded like a
nightmare.

However, the IRS gave everyone a way out, also known through-
out the legal industry as a safe harbor. If a company used a profes-
sional valuation firm, the valuation would be assumed to be correct
unless the IRS could prove otherwise, which is not an easy thing to
do. In contrast, if the company chose not to use a professional valu-
ation firm, then the company would have to prove the valuation was
correct, which is also a hard thing to do.

The predictable end result of this was the creation of an entirely
new line of business for accountants and a bunch of new valuation
firms. Section 409A effectively created new overhead for doing
business that helped support the accounting profession. Although

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="210" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Venture Deals" -->

we have a bunch of friends who work for 409A valuation firms, we
don't believe that any of this is additive in any way to the company
or to the value-creation process. Originally, these costs were about
$5,000 to $15,000 per year. Recently, eShares announced that they'll
do 409A valuations if a company signs up for a subscription fee as
little as $25 per month depending on the size of the company. Either
way, money spent here could easily be spent on something more use-
ful to the company, such as beer or search engine marketing.

An unfortunate side effect is that the 10% rule, where common
stock was typically valued at 10% of the preferred stock, is no longer
valid. We often see 409A valuations in early-stage companies valuing
common stock at 20% to 30% of the preferred stock. As a result,
employees make less money in a liquidity event, as options are more
expensive to purchase since their basis (or exercise price) is higher.

Ironically, the IRS also collects fewer taxes, as it receives tax only
on the value of the gain (sale price of the stock minus the exercise
price). In this case, the accountants are the only financial winners.

## Authors' Note

0
ver the course of this book, we've tried to expose you to all of the
issues you'll face during a venture capital financing. In addition to
the nuts and bolts of the term sheet, we've covered the participants
in the process, discussed how the fundraising process works, talked
about how venture capital firms operate, and described some basic
negotiating principles. We've also covered a bunch of dos and don'ts
around the fundraising process and, as a bonus, added a chapter
deconstructing a typical letter of intent that you'd receive at the
beginning of the acquisition process.

Though we are early-stage investors, we've tried to explain issues
that you'll face in any round of financing. We've tried to be balanced
between the entrepreneur's view and the VC's view, as we've been
both (although we've now been VCs for much longer). We've also
included an entrepreneur's perspective-from Matt Blumberg, the
CEO of Return Path-throughout the book.

We know much of this material is dry, and we tried hard to spice
it up with our own special brand of humor. We've reviewed it many
times but know there are likely some mistakes, as is inevitable with
something this complex and subjective. We learn the most from our
mistakes and encourage you to email us at jason@foundrygroup.com
or brad@foundrygroup.com with anything you find that is unclear
or that you believe is incorrect.

Of course, none of the information in this book should be con-
strued as legal advice from us. We are not your lawyers-just a pair
of guys who wrote a book that we hope is helpful to you. If you have
legal questions, ask your lawyers. Yes, our lawyers made us write this.

We hope this book has been helpful to you as you work to create
an amazing new company.

below.

<td>Pay-to-Play:</td>
<td>[Version 1: In the event of a Qualified Financing (as defined below), shares of Series A Preferred held by any Investor which is offered the right to participate but does not participate fully in such financing by purchasing at least its pro rata portion as calculated above under "Right of First Refusal" below will be converted into Common Stock.] [Version 2: If any holder of Series A Preferred Stock fails to participate in the next Qualified Financing (as defined below), on a pro rata basis (according to its total equity ownership immediately before such financing) of their Series A Preferred investment, then such holder will have the Series A Preferred Stock it owns converted into Common Stock of the Company. If such holder participates in the next Qualified Financing but not to the full extent of its pro rata share, then only a percentage of its Series A Preferred Stock will be converted into Common Stock (under the same terms as in the preceding sentence), with such percentage being equal to the percentage of its pro rata contribution that it failed to contribute.] A Qualified Financing is the next round of financing after the Series A financing by the Company that is approved by the Board of Directors who determine in good faith that such portion must be purchased pro rata among the stockholders of the Company subject to this provision. Such determination will be made regardless of whether the price is higher or lower than any series of Preferred Stock. When determining the number of shares held by an Investor or whether this "Pay-to-Play" provision has been satisfied, all shares held by or purchased in the Qualified Financing by affiliated investment funds shall be aggregated. An Investor shall be entitled to assign its rights to participate in this financing and future financings to its affiliated funds and to investors in the Investor and/or its affiliated funds, including funds that are not current stockholders of the Company.]</td>

<tr>
<td>Information Rights:</td>
<td>So long as an Investor continues to hold shares of Series A Preferred or Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Series A Preferred, the Company shall deliver to the Investor the Company's annual budget, as well as audited annual and unaudited quarterly financial statements. Furthermore, as soon as reasonably possible, the Company shall furnish a report to each Investor comparing each annual budget to such financial statements. Each Investor shall also be entitled to standard inspection and visitation rights. These provisions shall terminate upon a Qualified IPO.</td>

<td>Demand Rights: If Investors holding more than 50 percent of the outstanding shares of Series A Preferred, including Common Stock issued on conversion of Series A Preferred ("Registrable Securities"), or a lesser percentage if the anticipated aggregate offering price to the public is not less than $5 million, request that the Company file a Registration Statement, the Company will use its best efforts to cause such shares to be registered; provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to effect any such registration prior to the [third] anniversary of the Closing. The Company shall have the right to delay such registration under certain circumstances for one period not in excess of ninety (90) days in any twelve (12)-month period.</td>

The Company shall not be obligated to effect more than two (2) registrations
under these demand right provisions, and shall not be obligated to
effect a registration (i) during the one hundred eighty (180) day period
commencing with the date of the Company's initial public offering, or (ii) if it
delivers notice to the holders of the Registrable Securities within thirty (30)
days of any registration request of its intent to file a registration statement for
such initial public offering within ninety (90) days.

Company Registration: The Investors shall be entitled to "piggyback"
registration rights on all registrations of the Company or on any demand
registrations of any other investor subject to the right, however, of the
Company and its underwriters to reduce the number of shares proposed
to be registered pro rata in view of market conditions. If the Investors
are so limited, however, no party shall sell shares in such registration
other than the Company or the Investor, if any, invoking the demand
registration. Unless the registration is with respect to the Company's initial
public offering, in no event shall the shares to be sold by the Investors be
reduced below 30 percent of the total amount of securities included in the
registration. No shareholder of the Company shall be granted piggyback
registration rights, which would reduce the number of shares includable
by the holders of the Registrable Securities in such registration without the
consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Securities.

S-3 Rights: Investors shall be entitled to unlimited demand registrations
on Form S-3 (if available to the Company) so long as such registered
offerings are not less than $1 million.

Expenses: The Company shall bear registration expenses (exclusive
of underwriting discounts and commissions) of all such demands,
piggybacks, and S-3 registrations (including the expense of one special
counsel of the selling shareholders not to exceed $25,000).

Transfer of Rights: The registration rights may be transferred to (i) any
partner, member, or retired partner or member or affiliated fund of any
holder which is a partnership; (ii) any member or former member of
any holder which is a limited liability company; (iii) any family member
or trust for the benefit of any individual holder; or (iv) any transferee
which satisfies the criteria to be a Major Investor (as defined below);
provided the Company is given written notice thereof.

Lockup Provision: Each Investor agrees that it will not sell its shares
for a period to be specified by the managing underwriter (but not to
exceed 180 days) following the effective date of the Company's initial
public offering; provided that all officers, directors, and other 1 percent
shareholders are similarly bound. Such lockup agreement shall provide
that any discretionary waiver or termination of the restrictions of such
agreements by the Company or representatives of underwriters shall
apply to Major Investors, pro rata, based on the number of shares held.

Other Provisions: Other provisions shall be contained in the Investor
Rights Agreement with respect to registration rights as are reasonable,
including cross-indemnification, the period of time in which the
Registration Statement shall be kept effective, and underwriting
arrangements. The Company shall not require the opinion of Investor's
counsel before authorizing the transfer of stock or the removal of Rule
144 legends for routine sales under Rule 144 or for distribution to
partners or members of Investors.

## Appendix B: Sample Letter of Intent

,
20


### Seller A [Address]

Re: Proposal to Purchase Stock of the Company

Dear Sellers:

This letter is intended to summarize the principal terms of a proposal
being considered by
(the "Buyer") regarding its possible
acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of
(the
"Company")
from ("A") and
, who are the
Company's sole stockholders (the "Sellers"). In this letter, (i) the Buyer
and the Sellers are sometimes called the "Parties," (ii) the Company
and its subsidiaries are sometimes called the "Target Companies," and
(iii) the Buyer's possible acquisition of the stock of the Company is
sometimes called the "Possible Acquisition."


#### Part One

The Parties wish to commence negotiating a definitive written
acquisition agreement providing for the Possible Acquisition
(a "Definitive Agreement"). To facilitate the negotiation of a
Definitive Agreement, the Parties request that the Buyer's coun-
sel prepare an initial draft. The execution of any such Definitive
Agreement would be subject to the satisfactory completion of the
Buyer's ongoing investigation of the Target Companies' business,
and would also be subject to approval by the Buyer's board of
directors.

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="223" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="224" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Appendix B: Sample Letter of Intent" -->

Based on the information currently known to the Buyer, it is
proposed that the Definitive Agreement include the following
terms:


##### 1. Basic Transaction

The Sellers would sell all of the outstanding capital stock
of the Company to the Buyer at the price (the "Purchase
Price") set forth in Paragraph 2 below. The closing of this
transaction (the "Closing") would occur as soon as possible
after the termination of the applicable waiting period under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976
(the "HSR Act").


##### 2. Purchase Price

The Purchase Price would be $
(subject to
adjustment as described below) and would be paid in the fol-
lowing manner:

(a) At the Closing, the Buyer would pay the Sellers the sum of
$
in cash;

(b) at the Closing, the Buyer would deposit with a mutu-
ally acceptable escrow agent the sum of $
,
which would be held in escrow for a period of at least
years in order to secure the performance of
the Sellers' obligations under the Definitive Agreement
and related documents; and

(c) at the Closing, the Buyer would execute and deliver to
each Seller an unsecured, nonnegotiable, subordinated
promissory note. The promissory notes to be delivered to
the Sellers by the Buyer would have a combined princi-
pal amount of $
would bear interest at the

rate of
% per annum, would mature on the

anniversary of the Closing, and would pro-
vide for
equal [annual] [quarterly] payments
of principal along with [annual] [quarterly] payments of
accrued interest.

The Purchase Price assumes that the Target Compa-
nies have consolidated stockholders' equity of at least

$
as of the Closing. The Purchase Price would
be adjusted based on changes in the Target Companies' con-
solidated stockholders' equity as of the Closing, on a dollar-
for-dollar basis.

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="225" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Appendix B: Sample Letter of Intent" -->


##### 3. Employment and Noncompetition Agreements

At the Closing:

(a) the Company and A would enter into a
year
employment agreement under which A would agree to
continue to serve as the Company's [Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer] and would be entitled to receive
a salary of $
per year; and

(b) each Seller would execute a
year on compe-
tition agreement in favor of the Buyer and the Company.

4\. Other Terms

The Sellers would make comprehensive representations and
warranties to the Buyer, and would provide comprehensive
covenants, indemnities, and other protections for the benefit
of the Buyer. The consummation of the contemplated trans-
actions by the Buyer would be subject to the satisfaction of
various conditions, including:

(a)

(b)


###### Part Two

The following paragraphs of this letter (the "Binding Provisions")
are the legally binding and enforceable agreements of the Buyer and
each Seller.


####### 1. Access

During the period from the date this letter is signed by the
Sellers (the "Signing Date") until the date on which either
Party provides the other Party with written notice that nego-
tiations toward a Definitive Agreement are terminated (the
"Termination Date"), the Sellers will afford the Buyer full and
free access to each Target Company, its personnel, proper-
ties, contracts, books, and records, and all other documents
and data.


####### 2. Exclusive Dealing

Until the later of (i) [90] days after the Signing Date or (ii)
the Termination Date:

(a) the Sellers will not and will cause the Target Companies
not to, directly or indirectly, through any representative

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageNumber="226" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Appendix B: Sample Letter of Intent" -->

or otherwise, solicit or entertain offers from, negotiate
with or in any manner encourage, discuss, accept, or con-
sider any proposal of any other person relating to the
acquisition of the Shares or the Target Companies, their
assets or business, in whole or in part, whether directly or
indirectly, through purchase, merger, consolidation, or
otherwise (other than sales of inventory in the ordinary
course); and

(b) the Sellers will immediately notify the Buyer regarding
any contact between the Sellers, any Target Company
or their respective representatives, and any other per-
son regarding any such offer or proposal or any related
inquiry.


####### 3. Breakup Fee

vide to the Buyer written notice that negotiations toward
a Definitive Agreement are terminated, and (b) within

tion Date, as the case may be, either Seller or one or more
of the Target Companies signs a letter of intent or other
agreement relating to the acquisition of a material portion
of the Shares or of the Target Companies, their assets, or
business, in whole or in part, whether directly or indirectly,
through purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise
(other than sales of inventory or immaterial portions of
the Target Companies' assets in the ordinary course) and
such transaction is ultimately consummated, then, immedi-
ately upon the closing of such transaction, the Sellers will
pay, or cause the Target Companies to pay, to the Buyer the
sum $
. This fee will not serve as the exclu-
sive remedy to the Buyer under this letter in the event of
a breach by the Sellers of Paragraph 2 of this Part Two or
any other of the Binding Provisions, and the Buyer will be
entitled to all other rights and remedies provided by law or
in equity.


####### 4. Conduct of Business

During the period from the Signing Date until the Termina-

Buyer will promptly return to the Sellers or the Target Compa-
nies or destroy any Confidential Information in its possession
and certify in writing to the Sellers that it has done so.


####### 6. Disclosure

Except as and to the extent required by law, without the prior
written consent of the other Party, neither the Buyer nor the
Seller will make, and each will direct its representatives not to
make, directly or indirectly, any public comment, statement,
or communication with respect to, or otherwise to disclose
or to permit the disclosure of the existence of discussions
regarding, a possible transaction between the Parties or any
of the terms, conditions, or other aspects of the transaction
proposed in this letter. If a Party is required by law to make

disclosure is required by law, and the time and place that the
disclosure will be made.

## Appendix C: Additional Resources

Over the past few years there has been a Cambrian explosion of
entrepreneurial resources, including many around financing a
company. Following are several important ones:

Accelerators Accelerators modeled after Techstars (www
.techstars.com) and Y Combinator (www.ycombinator
.com) have emerged all over the world. These programs
typically invest a modest amount of money (around
$20,000) in companies in exchange for a small amount
of equity (typically 6%). In addition, some offer addi-
tional financing of $100,000 or more in the form of a
convertible note. The companies then go through a
90-day, intensive, full-time program where they acceler-
ate their startups via help from the accelerators, mentors,
and the surrounding startup communities. Several years
ago, Techstars founded the Global Accelerator Network
(www.gan.co) in an effort to link the best accelerators
and provide a series of best practices across them.

VentureDeals.com (www.venturedeals.com) This is the com-
panion website for Venture Deals and is maintained by us.
On it we have a blog where we answer questions submit-
ted via the website as well as highlight great blog posts
by other VCs. We include the Foundry Group form docu-
ments, other forms of financing documents, and sample
merger and acquisition (M&A) documents on the site. We
also have a list of many college courses that use Venture
Deals along with the syllabi for these courses.

Equity Crowdfunding If you are an entrepreneur raising
money or are an angel or seed VC looking for seed or early
stage investments, there are a number of websites that are
effectively a listing or matching service for you. The two
most popular ones, AngelList (www.angel.co) and Gust
(www.gust.com), have become very powerful resources for
both entrepreneurs and investors.

Product Crowdfunding Crowdfunding is a new form of financ-
ing that has been enabled by the Internet. Popular sites
like Kickstarter (www.kickstarter.com) and Indiegogo (www
.indiegogo.com) have popularized the first phase of this,
where companies can use crowd funding to raise money
to build their products. In the current model, companies
are effectively getting their customers to prepay for their
product or service. In April 2012 in the United States, the
Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act was passed,
which provides for equity crowdfunding, or the ability of a
company to use the notion of crowdfunding to raise equity.

Databases A number of private company databases, includ-
ing Mattermark (www.mattermark.com) and Crunchbase
(www.crunchbase.com) exist. Keep in mind that with all
private company data, accuracy varies a lot, so you'll find
some noise here, but in general the signal is high. If you
don't have a strong VC network, these databases can help
you identify the VCs who might be interested in your par-
ticular company.

Education There is an enormous amount of entrepreneurship-
oriented educational resources on the Web. Several of our
favorites include the Kauffman Foundation (www.kauffman.org),
Stanford University's Entrepreneurship Corner (http://
ecorner.stanford.edu), Khan Academy's venture capital
courses (http://bit.ly/2agRJRB), and the Silicon Flatirons
Center right here in our hamlet of Boulder, Colorado (www
.siliconflatirons.com).

National Venture Capital Association The NVCA (http://nvca
.org) maintains the most widely used set of model documents
used in financings (http:// nvca.org/resources/model-legal-
documents).

Other Tech Blogs There are numerous tech and VC blog-
gers who produce significant amounts of excellent con-
tent. Several of our good friends, including Fred Wilson
(www.avc.com), Mark Suster (www.bothsidesofthetable.
com), David Cohen (www.davidgcohen.com), and Seth
Levine (www.sethlevine.com), regularly produce excel-
lent content. Brownstein & Egusa (www.brownsteinegusa.
com/find-tech-reporters) also has an extensive list of tech
reporters and bloggers. Finally, Mattermark Daily (mattermark
.com/newsletters) provides a daily digest of timely, must-
read posts by investors and operators.

## Foreword to the First and Second Editions

wish I'd had this book when I started my first company. At
the time, I didn't know preferred stock from chicken stock and
thought a right of first refusal was something that applied to the
NFL waiver wire.

Today, as the CEO of Twitter and the founder of three previous
companies, the latter two acquired by public companies and the first
acquired by a private company, I've learned many of the concepts
and lessons in this book the hard way. While I had some great inves-
tors and advisers along the way, I still had to figure out all the tricks,
traps, and nuances on my own.

My partners in my first company-Burning Door Networked
Media-and I were novices, so we made a lot of mistakes, but we man-
aged to sell the company in 1996 for enough money to keep ourselves
knee-deep in Starbucks tall coffees every morning for a year.

Several years later, my partners at Burning Door and I started a
new company called Spyonit. This company did better and was sold
to a public company called 724 Solutions in September 2000. Our
stock was tied up for a year (we weren't that tuned into registration
rights at the time) and when we got our hands on the stock in mid-
September 2001, the collapse of the Internet bubble and the finan-
cial aftermath of 9/11 had caused our stock to decline to the point
that it was worth enough money to keep us knee-deep in tall skim
lattes at Starbucks every morning for a year.

So, like all good entrepreneurs, we tried again. This time, armed
with a lot more knowledge and humility, we started FeedBurner in
2004. We raised several rounds of venture capital, including a seed
round from DFJ Portage, a Series A round from Mobius Venture

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageNumber="236" -->
<!-- PageHeader="Foreword to the First and Second Editions" -->

Capital (the firm Brad Feld and Jason Mendelson were part of at
the time) and Sutter Hill, and a Series B round from Union Square
Ventures. FeedBurner grew quickly, and before we knew it we had
attracted acquisition interest from several companies, including
Google, which purchased us in 2007 and allowed me to stop using
coffee-purchase analogies to quantify the payout.

After spending several years at Google, I was recruited to join
Twitter, where I now am the CEO. During my tenure with the com-
pany, Twitter has grown dramatically, from 50 people to more than
430 people, and has completed two major rounds of financing, hav-
ing raised over $250 million.

When I reflect back on what I now know about VC deals, acqui-
sitions, how VCs work, and how to negotiate, it's very satisfying to
see how far I've come from that day back in the early 1990s when I
cofounded Burning Door Networked Media. When I read through
this book, I kept thinking over and over, "Where were you when I
started out?" as the knowledge contained between these covers
would have saved me a remarkable amount of time and money on
my journey.

Brad and Jason have written a book that is hugely important for
any aspiring entrepreneurs, students, and first-time entrepreneurs.
But it's not just limited to them-as I read through it I found new
pearls of wisdom that even with all the experience I have today I can
put to good use. And if you are a VC or aspire to be a VC, get in the
front of the line to read this to make sure you are armed with a full
range of understanding of the dynamics of your business. Finally, if
you are a lawyer who does these deals for a living, do yourself a favor
and read this also, if only to be armed with things to use to torture
your adversaries.

# CHAPTER THREE


# PRINCIPLES OF ATION VIBRANT STARTUP COMMUNITY

N
ow that you've had an introduction to Boulder and its history from
my point of view, I'd like to describe the principles that drive the
Boulder startup community, which I'll call the Boulder Thesis. First,
however, I'll discuss the three historical frameworks that have been used to
describe why some cities become vibrant startup communities.


## HISTORICAL FRAMEWORKS

The investigation into startup communities is among the most important
inquiries of our time. Why do some places flourish with innovation while
others wither? What are the determinants that help a startup community
achieve critical startup mass? Once under way, how does a startup commu-
nity sustain and expand entrepreneurship? Why do startup communities
persist, despite often having higher real estate costs and wages than other

<!-- PageNumber="263" -->

<!-- PageHeader="STARTUP COMMUNITIES" -->

areas? At stake is nothing less than the continued economic vitality, and
even the very existence of towns, cities, and regions.

Studies show that the geography of innovation is neither democratic
nor flat. This may be surprising since you might think that location should
matter less than ever in today's society. Information can be quickly sent and
received by anyone from almost anywhere. In theory, expanding access to
resources and information from anywhere might decouple the relationship
between place and innovation.

Economic geographers, however, observe the opposite effect. Evidence
suggests that location, rather than being irrelevant, is more important
than ever. Innovation tilts heavily toward certain locations and, as scholar
Richard Florida (professor at Rotman School of Management, at the
University of Toronto and author of The Rise of the Creative Class (2002))
says, is "spiky" with great concentration of creative, innovative people in
tightly clustered geographies. Location clearly matters.

Three prominent frameworks explain why some locales are hotbeds
of entrepreneurship whereas others are the innovation equivalent of
a twenty-first century economic mirage. Each explanation of regional
entrepreneurial advantage comes from a different discipline-one from
economics, another from sociology, and a third from geography. These
explanations are, for the most part, nonexclusive and complementary.

The first explanation, external or agglomeration economies, comes from
economics. This line of analysis reaches back to the research of economist
Alfred Marshall, and, in recent decades, Michael Porter, Paul Krugman, and
Paul Romer have deepened this account. External economies focus on the
benefits of startup concentration in an area. This explanation focuses on eco-
nomic concepts as they apply to location. One is that companies co-located
in an area benefit from "external economies of scale." Emerging companies
need certain common inputs-for example, infrastructure, specialized legal
and accounting services, suppliers, labor pools with a specialized knowledge
base-that reside outside the company. Companies in a common geographic
area share the fixed costs of these resources external to the company. As

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageBreak -->


### Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community

more and more startups in an area can share the costs of specialized inputs,
the average cost per startup drops for the specialized inputs. This provides
direct economic benefit to companies located within a startup community.

Another economic concept, network effects, explains why geographic
concentration yields further advantage. Network effects operate in systems
where the addition of a member to a network enhances value for existing
users. The Internet, Facebook, and Twitter are examples in which network
effects operate powerfully. These services may have some value to you if
there are just 100 other users. However, these networks are immensely
more useful if there are 100 million other users that you can connect with.
Startup communities similarly feature strong network effects. For example,
an area with 10 great programmers provides a valuable pool of labor talent
for a startup. However, an additional 1,000 amazing programmers in the
same area is vastly more valuable to startups, especially if programmers
share best practices with other programmers, inspire one another, or start
new companies. External economies of scale lower certain costs; mean-
while, network effects make co-location more valuable.

The second explanation of startup communities, horizontal networks,
comes from sociology. In her PhD work at MIT, AnnaLee Saxenian
(currently Dean of the UC Berkeley School of Information) noticed that
external economies do not fully explain the development and adapta-
tion of startup communities. In particular, in her seminal book Regional
Advantage: Culture and Competition in Silicon Valley and Route 128 (1994)
Saxenian noted that two hotbeds for high-tech activity-Silicon Valley
and Boston's Route 128-looked very similar in the mid-1980s. Each area
enjoyed agglomeration economies associated with the nation's two high-
tech regions. Yet just a decade later, Silicon Valley gained a dominant
advantage over Route 128. External economies alone did not provide an
answer. Saxenian set out to resolve the puzzle of why Silicon Valley far
outpaced Route 128 from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s.

Saxenian persuasively argues that a culture of openness and information
exchange fueled Silicon Valley's ascent over Route 128. This argument is tied

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="265" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="STARTUP COMMUNITIES" -->

to network effects, which are better leveraged by a community with a culture
of information sharing across companies and industries. Saxenian observed
that the porous boundaries between Silicon Valley companies, such as Sun
Microsystems and HP, stood in stark contrast to the closed-loop and autar-
kic companies of Route 128, such as DEC and Apollo. More broadly, Silicon
Valley culture embraced a horizontal exchange of information across and
between companies. Rapid technological disruption played perfectly to
Silicon Valley's culture of open information exchange and labor mobility.
As technology quickly changed, the Silicon Valley companies were better
positioned to share information, adopt new trends, leverage innovation,
and nimbly respond to new conditions. Meanwhile, vertical integration and
closed systems disadvantaged many Route 128 companies during periods of
technological upheaval. Saxenian highlights the role of a densely networked
culture in explaining Silicon Valley's successful industrial adaptation as com-
pared to Route 128.

Finally, the third explanation of startup communities, the notion of
the creative class, comes from geography. Richard Florida describes the
tie between innovation and creative-class individuals. The creative class
is composed of individuals such as entrepreneurs, engineers, professors,
and artists who create "meaningful new forms." Creative-class individuals,
Florida argues, want to live in nice places, enjoy a culture with a toler-
ance for new ideas and weirdness, and-most of all-want to be around
other creative-class individuals. This is another example of network effects,
because a virtuous cycle exists where the existence of a creative class in
an area attracts more creative-class individuals to the area, which in turn
makes the area even more valuable and attractive. A location that hits criti-
cal mass enjoys a competitive geographic advantage over places that have
yet to attract a significant number of creative-class individuals.

Each of the three explanations just outlined provides a useful lens
to understand why the entrepreneurial world has concentrations of
startup communities in specific geographies. They are incomplete, how-
ever, concerning how to put a startup community into motion. There is a

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->

<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community" -->

serious chicken and egg problem; although it is not difficult to see why
innovation havens have an advantage, it is more challenging to explain
how to get a startup community up and running.


## THE BOULDER THESIS

I suggest a fourth framework based on our experience in Boulder. Let's call
it the Boulder Thesis. This framework has four key components:

1\. Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community.

2\. The leaders must have a long-term commitment.

3\. The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to
participate in it.

4\. The startup community must have continual activities that engage
the entire entrepreneurial stack.


## LED BY ENTREPRENEURS

The most critical principle of a startup community is that entrepreneurs
must lead it. Lots of different people are involved in the startup community
and many nonentrepreneurs play key roles. Unless the entrepreneurs lead,
the startup community will not be sustainable over time.

In virtually every major city, there are long lists of different types of peo-
ple and organizations who are involved in the startup community including
government, universities, investors, mentors, and service providers. His-
torically, many of these organizations try to play a leadership role in the
development of their local startup community. Although their involvement
is important, they can't be the leaders. The entrepreneurs have to be leaders.

I define an entrepreneur as someone who has co-founded a company. I
differentiate between "high-growth entrepreneurial companies" and "small

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="267" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="STARTUP COMMUNITIES" -->

businesses." Both are important, but they are different things. Entrepre-
neurial companies have the potential to be or are high-growth businesses
whereas small businesses tend to be local, profitable, but slow-growth
organizations. Small-business people are often "pillars of their commu-
nity" as their businesses have a tight co-dependency with their community.
By contrast, founders of high-growth entrepreneurial companies generally
are involved in the local community as employers and indirect contribu-
tors to small businesses and the local economy, but they rarely are involved
in the broad business community because they are extraordinarily focused
on their companies.

Because of this intense focus, it's unrealistic to think that all entrepre-
neurs in a community will be leaders. All that is needed is a critical mass of
entrepreneurs, often less than a dozen, who will provide leadership.


## LONG-TERM COMMITMENT

These leaders have to make a long-term commitment to their startup com-
munity. I like to say this has to be at least 20 years from today to reinforce
the sense that this has to be meaningful in length. Optimally, the commit-
ment resets daily; it should be a forward-looking 20-year commitment.

It's well understood that economies run in cycles. Economies grow,
peak, decline, bottom out, grow again, peak again, decline again, and bot-
tom out again. Some of these cycles are modest. Some are severe. The
lengths vary dramatically.

Startup communities have to take a very long-term view. A great
startup community such as Silicon Valley (1950-today) has a long trajec-
tory. Although they have their booms and busts, they continued to grow,
develop, and expand throughout this period of time.

Most cities and their leaders get excited about entrepreneurship after
a major economic decline. They focus on it for a few years through a peak.
When the subsequent decline ultimately happens, they focus on other

<!-- PageFooter="www.itdf.ir" -->
<!-- PageNumber="268" -->
<!-- PageBreak -->

<!-- PageHeader="Principles of a Vibrant Startup Community" -->

things during the downturn. When things bottom out, most of the progress
gained during the upswing was lost. I've seen this several times-first in the
early 1990s and again around the Internet bubble. All you have to do is think
back to the nickname of your city during the Internet bubble (Silicon Alley,
Silicon Swamp, Silicon Slopes, Silicon Prairie, Silicon Gulch, and Silicon
Mountain) to remember what it was like before and after the peak.

This is why the leaders have to first be entrepreneurs and then have a
long-term view. These leaders must be committed to the continuous devel-
opment of their startup community, regardless of the economic cycle their
city, state, or country is in. Great entrepreneurial companies, such as Apple,
Genentech, Microsoft, and Intel, were started during down economic cycles.
It takes such a long time to create something powerful that, almost by defi-
nition, you'll go through several economic cycles on the path to glory.

If you aspire to be a leader of your startup community, but you aren't
willing to live where you are for the next 20 years and work hard at lead-
ing the startup community for that period of time, ask yourself what your
real motivation for being a leader is. Although you can have impact for
a shorter period of time, it'll take at least this level of commitment from
some leaders to sustain a vibrant startup community.


## FOSTER A PHILOSOPHY OF INCLUSIVENESS

A startup community must be extremely inclusive. Anyone who wants to
engage should be able to, whether they are changing careers, moving
to your city, graduating from college, or just want to do something differ-
ent. This applies to entrepreneurs, people who want to work for startups,
people who want to work with startups, or people who are simply intellec-
tually interested in startups.

This philosophy of inclusiveness applies at all levels of the startup com-
munity. The leaders have to be open to having more leaders involved, recog-
nizing that leaders need to be entrepreneurs who have a long-term view of

building their startup community. Entrepreneurs in the community need
to welcome other entrepreneurs, viewing the growth of the startup com-
munity as a positive force for all, rather than a zero-sum game in which
new entrepreneurs compete locally for resources and status. Employees of
startups need to recruit their friends and open their homes and city to
other people who have moved into the community.

Everyone in the startup community should have a perspective that
having more people engaged in the startup community is good for the
startup community. Building a startup community is not a zero-sum game
in which there are winners and losers; if everyone engages, they and the
entire community can all be winners.


## ENGAGE THE ENTIRE ENTREPRENEURIAL STACK

Startup communities must have regular activities that engage the entire
entrepreneurial stack. This includes first-time entrepreneurs, experienced
entrepreneurs, aspiring entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, employees of
startups, service providers to startups, and anyone else who wants to be
involved.

Over the years, I've been to many entrepreneurial award events, peri-
odic cocktail parties, monthly networking events, panel discussions, and
open houses. Although these types of activities have a role, typically in shin-
ing a bright light on the people doing good things within the startup com-
munity, they don't really engage anyone in any real entrepreneurial activity.

The emergence of hackathons, new tech meetups, open coffee clubs,
startup weekends, and accelerators like TechStars stand out in stark con-
trast. These are activities and events, which I will cover in depth later in
this book, that last from a few hours to three months and provide a tan-
gible, focused, set of activities for the members of the startup community
to engage in. By being inclusive of the startup community, these activities
consistently engage the entire entrepreneurial stack.

Some of these activities will last for decades; others will go strong for
a few years and then fade away; others will fail to thrive and die quickly.
This dynamic is analogous to startups-it's okay to try things that fail, and
the startup community must recognize when something isn't working
and move on. The leaders of the failed activity should try again to cre-
ate things that engage the entire entrepreneurial stack, and participants in
failed activities should keep on engaging in stuff, recognizing that they are
playing a long-term game.
